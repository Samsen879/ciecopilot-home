## Momentum: Direct Collisions and Conservation

**Syllabus Reference**: 9709.P4.4.3
**Learning Objective**: Apply the principle of conservation of linear momentum to solve problems involving the direct collision of two particles, including cases where they coalesce.

### Example Question
Two particles, $A$ and $B$, of masses $0.4$ kg and $0.6$ kg respectively, are moving towards each other along the same straight line on a smooth horizontal surface. Immediately before they collide, the speed of $A$ is $5$ m s$^{-1}$ and the speed of $B$ is $3$ m s$^{-1}$. After the collision, the direction of motion of $A$ is reversed and its speed is $1$ m s$^{-1}$.

Find the speed and direction of motion of particle $B$ immediately after the collision.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
Let the initial direction of particle $A$ be the positive direction.

Initial momentum of $A = m_A u_A = 0.4 \times 5 = 2$ kg m s$^{-1}$.
Initial momentum of $B = m_B u_B = 0.6 \times (-3) = -1.8$ kg m s$^{-1}$. (B1)

Total initial momentum = $2 + (-1.8) = 0.2$ kg m s$^{-1}$.

Let the velocity of $B$ after the collision be $v_B$.
Final momentum of $A = m_A v_A = 0.4 \times (-1) = -0.4$ kg m s$^{-1}$.
Final momentum of $B = m_B v_B = 0.6 v_B$.

Apply the Principle of Conservation of Momentum:
Total initial momentum = Total final momentum
$m_A u_A + m_B u_B = m_A v_A + m_B v_B$ (M1)
$0.2 = -0.4 + 0.6 v_B$ (A1)

$0.6 = 0.6 v_B$
$v_B = 1$ m s$^{-1}$ (A1)

Since $v_B$ is positive, the direction of motion of $B$ is the same as the initial direction of $A$.

### Standard Solution Steps
- Define a positive direction. It is often simplest to choose the initial direction of one of the particles.
- Draw a clear "before" and "after" diagram, labelling the masses, velocities, and the chosen positive direction for each particle.
- Write down the total momentum of the system before the collision. Remember that velocity is a vector, so any particle moving in the negative direction has a negative velocity.
- Write down the total momentum of the system after the collision. Use a variable for any unknown velocity.
- Equate the total momentum before and after the collision.
- Solve the resulting linear equation for the unknown velocity.
- Interpret the sign of the result to state the final direction of motion.

### Common Mistakes
- **Sign errors:** The most frequent mistake is failing to assign a negative sign to the velocity of a particle moving in the opposite direction to the defined positive direction.
- **Algebraic errors:** Incorrectly rearranging the conservation of momentum equation.
- **Ignoring direction:** Stating only the speed as the final answer when the direction is also required. A positive result means it moves in the positive direction; a negative result means it moves in the negative direction.
- **Mixing up masses:** Accidentally swapping the masses of the particles in the formula.

## Momentum: Collision and Coalescence

**Syllabus Reference**: 9709.P4.4.3
**Learning Objective**: Apply the principle of conservation of linear momentum to problems where particles coalesce upon collision.

### Example Question
A particle $P$ of mass $2$ kg is moving with speed $6$ m s$^{-1}$ on a smooth horizontal plane. A second particle $Q$ of mass $4$ kg is at rest. Particle $P$ collides directly with particle $Q$. After the collision, $P$ and $Q$ coalesce to form a single combined particle.

Find the speed of the combined particle immediately after the collision.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
Let the initial direction of motion of $P$ be the positive direction.

Initial momentum of $P = m_P u_P = 2 \times 6 = 12$ kg m s$^{-1}$.
Initial momentum of $Q = m_Q u_Q = 4 \times 0 = 0$ kg m s$^{-1}$. (B1)
Total initial momentum = $12 + 0 = 12$ kg m s$^{-1}$.

After the collision, the particles coalesce. The combined mass is $m_P + m_Q = 2 + 4 = 6$ kg.
Let the velocity of the combined particle be $v$.
Total final momentum = $(m_P + m_Q)v = 6v$.

Apply the Principle of Conservation of Momentum:
$m_P u_P + m_Q u_Q = (m_P + m_Q)v$ (M1)
$12 = 6v$ (A1)

$v = \frac{12}{6} = 2$ m s$^{-1}$ (A1)

The speed of the combined particle is $2$ m s$^{-1}$.

### Standard Solution Steps
- Define a positive direction, usually the direction of the moving particle.
- Calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision. Note that stationary particles have zero momentum.
- For coalescence, the final state consists of a single particle. Calculate the combined mass by adding the individual masses.
- Write an expression for the final momentum of the combined particle, using the combined mass and a single final velocity, $v$.
- Apply the conservation of momentum principle: total initial momentum = total final momentum.
- Solve the equation for the final velocity $v$.

### Common Mistakes
- **Incorrect final mass:** Forgetting to add the masses of the two particles together for the final momentum calculation.
- **Calculation errors:** Simple arithmetic mistakes when calculating initial momentum or solving for the final velocity.
- **Conceptual error:** Applying the coalescence formula $(m_1+m_2)v$ in a situation where the particles do not stick together. Read the question carefully to determine the outcome of the collision.
- **Ignoring stationary particles:** Forgetting that a stationary particle has a momentum of zero, which must be included in the 'total initial momentum' sum.

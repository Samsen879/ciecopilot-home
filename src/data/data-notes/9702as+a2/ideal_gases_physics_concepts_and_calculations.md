## Ideal Gases: The Ideal Gas Equation

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.15
**Learning Objective**: Recall and apply the ideal gas equation $pV=nRT$ in calculations.

### Example Question
A cylinder of fixed volume $0.050$ m$^3$ contains oxygen gas at a pressure of $4.5 \times 10^5$ Pa and a temperature of $300$ K. The universal gas constant $R$ is $8.31$ J K$^{-1}$ mol$^{-1}$.

(a) Calculate the amount, in moles, of oxygen gas in the cylinder.
(b) The gas is heated, causing the pressure to increase to $5.2 \times 10^5$ Pa. Calculate the new temperature of the gas in degrees Celsius.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
- (a) Use of ideal gas equation $pV = nRT$ and rearrangement to $n = \frac{pV}{RT}$. (M1)
- Correct substitution: $n = \frac{(4.5 \times 10^5)(0.050)}{(8.31)(300)}$. (C1)
- Final answer for moles: $n = 9.03$ mol. (A1)
- (b) For a fixed mass and volume of gas, $\frac{P}{T} = \text{constant}$, so $\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}$. (M1)
- Rearrangement to find $T_2$: $T_2 = T_1 \times \frac{P_2}{P_1} = 300 \times \frac{5.2 \times 10^5}{4.5 \times 10^5}$. (C1)
- $T_2 = 346.7$ K. (A1)
- Conversion to Celsius: $T(^{\circ}\text{C}) = 346.7 - 273.15 = 73.55\ ^{\circ}\text{C}$. (A1)

### Standard Solution Steps
- For part (a), identify the ideal gas equation $pV=nRT$ as the relevant formula. Rearrange it to make the amount of substance $n$ the subject.
- Substitute the given values for pressure $P$, volume $V$, gas constant $R$, and temperature $T$ in Kelvin.
- Calculate the final value for $n$.
- For part (b), recognise that for a fixed amount of gas in a fixed volume, the pressure is directly proportional to the thermodynamic temperature ($\frac{P}{T}$ is constant).
- Set up a ratio equation: $\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}$.
- Solve for the final temperature $T_2$ in Kelvin.
- Convert the final temperature from Kelvin to degrees Celsius by subtracting 273.15.

### Common Mistakes
- Using temperature in degrees Celsius instead of Kelvin in the ideal gas equation. All calculations with $pV=nRT$ must use Kelvin.
- Forgetting to convert units to base SI units if they are given in non-standard units (e.g., cm$^3$ for volume or kPa for pressure).
- Algebraic errors when rearranging the ideal gas equation or the ratio equation.
- In questions with two states, incorrectly mixing up initial and final values of pressure and temperature.

## Ideal Gases: Kinetic Theory and Pressure

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.15
**Learning Objective**: Understand the assumptions of the kinetic theory and use the equation $pV = \frac{1}{3}Nm<c^2>$.

### Example Question
A sealed container of volume $1.5 \times 10^{-2}$ m$^3$ contains an ideal gas at a pressure of $2.0 \times 10^5$ Pa. The gas consists of $4.0 \times 10^{23}$ molecules, each of mass $5.3 \times 10^{-26}$ kg.

(a) State two assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases.
(b) Calculate the mean-square-speed $<c^2>$ of the gas molecules.
(c) Calculate the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) speed of the gas molecules.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
- (a) Any two from:
    - The volume of the molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container.
    - Collisions between molecules and with the walls of the container are perfectly elastic.
    - There are no intermolecular forces of attraction or repulsion.
    - Molecules are in continuous random motion.
    - The duration of a collision is negligible compared to the time between collisions. (B1 for each correct assumption, max 2)
- (b) Use of the kinetic theory equation $pV = \frac{1}{3}Nm<c^2>$. (M1)
- Rearrangement to $<c^2> = \frac{3pV}{Nm}$. (C1)
- Correct substitution: $<c^2> = \frac{3 \times (2.0 \times 10^5) \times (1.5 \times 10^{-2})}{(4.0 \times 10^{23}) \times (5.3 \times 10^{-26})}$. (C1)
- Mean-square-speed $<c^2> = 4.25 \times 10^5$ m$^2$ s$^{-2}$. (A1)
- (c) r.m.s. speed = $\sqrt{<c^2>} = \sqrt{4.25 \times 10^5}$. (M1)
- Final answer: r.m.s. speed = $652$ m s$^{-1}$. (A1)

### Standard Solution Steps
- For part (a), recall any two of the fundamental assumptions made when modelling a gas using the kinetic theory.
- For part (b), identify the correct formula linking macroscopic properties ($p, V$) to microscopic properties ($N, m, <c^2>$).
- Rearrange the equation to make the mean-square-speed $<c^2>$ the subject.
- Substitute all the given values into the rearranged equation and calculate the result.
- For part (c), recall that the root-mean-square speed is the square root of the mean-square-speed.
- Calculate the square root of the value found in part (b).

### Common Mistakes
- Confusing mean-square-speed ($<c^2>$) with root-mean-square speed ($c_{rms}$). The formula gives $<c^2>$.
- Algebraic errors when rearranging the formula, for example, forgetting the factor of 3.
- Using the number of moles ($n$) instead of the number of molecules ($N$), or the molar mass instead of the mass of a single molecule ($m$).
- Calculation errors with powers of ten.

## Ideal Gases: Kinetic Energy and Temperature

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.15
**Learning Objective**: Relate the average translational kinetic energy of molecules to thermodynamic temperature using $E_k = \frac{3}{2}kT$.

### Example Question
A sample of helium gas is at a temperature of $27\ ^{\circ}\text{C}$. The mass of a helium atom is $6.65 \times 10^{-27}$ kg. The Boltzmann constant $k$ is $1.38 \times 10^{-23}$ J K$^{-1}$.

(a) Calculate the average translational kinetic energy of a helium atom.
(b) Calculate the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) speed of a helium atom.
(c) The temperature of the gas is doubled. State the factor by which the r.m.s. speed of the helium atoms increases.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
- (a) Convert temperature to Kelvin: $T = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15$ K. (C1)
- Use of $E_k = \frac{3}{2}kT$. (M1)
- Correct substitution: $E_k = \frac{3}{2} \times (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \times (300.15)$. (C1)
- Final answer for energy: $E_k = 6.21 \times 10^{-21}$ J. (A1)
- (b) Equate kinetic energy expressions: $\frac{1}{2}m<c^2> = 6.21 \times 10^{-21}$ J. (M1)
- Rearrange to find $<c^2> = \frac{2 \times E_k}{m} = \frac{2 \times (6.21 \times 10^{-21})}{6.65 \times 10^{-27}} = 1.868 \times 10^6$ m$^2$ s$^{-2}$. (C1)
- r.m.s. speed = $\sqrt{1.868 \times 10^6} = 1370$ m s$^{-1}$. (A1)
- (c) $c_{rms} \propto \sqrt{T}$. If $T$ is doubled, $c_{rms}$ increases by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. (B1)

### Standard Solution Steps
- For part (a), first convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin.
- Use the formula $E_k = \frac{3}{2}kT$ to directly calculate the average kinetic energy of a single atom.
- For part (b), equate the two expressions for average kinetic energy: $\frac{1}{2}m<c^2> = \frac{3}{2}kT$.
- Rearrange this relationship to solve for the mean-square-speed $<c^2>$, or use the value of $E_k$ from part (a).
- Calculate the r.m.s. speed by taking the square root of $<c^2>$.
- For part (c), analyse the relationship $c_{rms} \propto \sqrt{T}$. Determine how a change in $T$ affects $c_{rms}$.

### Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin before any calculations.
- Using the wrong formula, for example using $E=kT$ or $E=\frac{1}{2}kT$.
- Confusing the gas constant $R$ with the Boltzmann constant $k$. Remember $k$ is for single molecules, $R$ is for moles.
- Forgetting to take the square root to find the r.m.s. speed from the mean-square-speed.
- In part (c), incorrectly stating that the speed doubles when the temperature doubles. The speed increases by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

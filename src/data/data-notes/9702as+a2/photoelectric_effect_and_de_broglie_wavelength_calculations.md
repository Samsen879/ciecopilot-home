## Quantum Physics: Photoelectric Effect and Wave-Particle Duality

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.22
**Learning Objective**: Understand the concepts of the photon, the photoelectric effect, and the de Broglie wavelength.

### Example Question
Light of wavelength 450 nm is incident on a metal surface. The work function of the metal is 2.0 eV.

(a) Calculate the energy, in joules, of a single photon of this light.
(b) Determine the maximum kinetic energy, in joules, of an electron emitted from the surface.
(c) Calculate the threshold frequency for the photoelectric effect to occur on this metal surface.
(d) Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron emitted with the maximum kinetic energy.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
(a) Use the formula $E = hc/\lambda$. [C1]
$E = (6.63 \times 10^{-34} \times 3.00 \times 10^8) / (450 \times 10^{-9})$ [M1]
$E = 4.42 \times 10^{-19}$ J [A1]

(b) First, convert the work function energy $\Phi$ from eV to J.
$\Phi = 2.0 \times 1.60 \times 10^{-19} = 3.20 \times 10^{-19}$ J [M1]
Use the photoelectric equation $E = \Phi + E_{k,max}$. [C1]
$E_{k,max} = (4.42 \times 10^{-19}) - (3.20 \times 10^{-19}) = 1.22 \times 10^{-19}$ J [A1]

(c) Use the formula $\Phi = hf_0$. [C1]
$f_0 = \Phi / h = (3.20 \times 10^{-19}) / (6.63 \times 10^{-34})$
$f_0 = 4.83 \times 10^{14}$ Hz [A1]

(d) First, find the momentum $p$ of the electron using $E_k = p^2 / (2m_e)$.
$p = \sqrt{2 m_e E_{k,max}}$
$p = \sqrt{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 1.22 \times 10^{-19}}$ [M1]
$p = 4.71 \times 10^{-25}$ kg m s⁻¹
Use the de Broglie wavelength formula $\lambda = h/p$. [C1]
$\lambda = (6.63 \times 10^{-34}) / (4.71 \times 10^{-25}) = 1.41 \times 10^{-9}$ m [A1]

### Standard Solution Steps
- For (a), calculate the energy of an incident photon using the formula $E = hc/\lambda$. Ensure the wavelength is converted from nm to m.
- For (b), first convert the work function from electronvolts (eV) to joules (J) by multiplying by $1.60 \times 10^{-19}$. Then, apply the photoelectric effect equation, $E_{k,max} = E - \Phi$, to find the maximum kinetic energy.
- For (c), use the relationship between work function and threshold frequency, $\Phi = hf_0$. Rearrange to find $f_0$. Use the work function value in joules.
- For (d), use the maximum kinetic energy of the electron to find its momentum using the formula $E_k = p^2 / (2m_e)$. Then, use the momentum in the de Broglie wavelength equation, $\lambda = h/p$.

### Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to convert energy units between electronvolts (eV) and joules (J), or wavelength from nanometres (nm) to metres (m).
- Using the photoelectric equation incorrectly, for example, adding the work function instead of subtracting it.
- Confusing the frequency of the incident light ($f$) with the threshold frequency ($f_0$).
- Using the wavelength of the incident photon in the de Broglie equation instead of calculating the wavelength of the emitted electron.
- Calculation errors involving powers of ten or when taking square roots.
- Using the wrong mass in calculations, for example, the mass of a proton instead of an electron.

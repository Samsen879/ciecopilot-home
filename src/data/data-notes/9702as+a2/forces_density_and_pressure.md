## Forces, density and pressure: Principle of Moments & Equilibrium

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.4
**Learning Objective**: state and apply the principle of moments; define and apply the concept of the centre of gravity of an object; determine the position of the centre of gravity of a uniform body

 

### Example Question
A non-uniform rod AB of length 80.0 cm has a weight of 15.0 N. The rod is pivoted at point P, which is 30.0 cm from end A. The centre of gravity, G, of the rod is 35.0 cm from end A. An object of weight *W* is hung from end A to keep the rod in equilibrium, as shown.

Diagram: A non-uniform rod AB pivoted at P (30.0 cm from A). G is 35.0 cm from A. A weight W hangs from A.

(a) State the principle of moments.
(b) Calculate the weight *W* required to keep the rod in horizontal equilibrium.
(c) A force is applied at end B to maintain equilibrium without the weight *W* at A. Calculate the magnitude and state the direction of this force.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
(a) For an object to be in rotational equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about any pivot must be equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same pivot. [B1]

(b) **Identify forces and distances from the pivot P:**
   - Weight *W* at A: This creates an anticlockwise moment.
     Distance from pivot = 30.0 cm = 0.300 m.
   - Weight of the rod (15.0 N) at G: This creates a clockwise moment.
     Distance from pivot = 35.0 cm - 30.0 cm = 5.0 cm = 0.050 m. [C1]

   **Apply the principle of moments:**
   Sum of anticlockwise moments = Sum of clockwise moments [M1]
   *W* × (0.300 m) = 15.0 N × (0.050 m) [M1]
   *W* × 0.300 = 0.75
   *W* = 0.75 / 0.300
   *W* = 2.5 N [A1]

(c) **New setup:** Force *F* at end B, no weight at A.
   - The rod's weight (15.0 N) still creates a clockwise moment of 0.75 Nm.
   - To balance this, force *F* at B must create an anticlockwise moment. Therefore, the force *F* must be directed **upwards**. [B1]
   - Distance of end B from pivot P = 80.0 cm - 30.0 cm = 50.0 cm = 0.500 m.

   **Apply the principle of moments:**
   Anticlockwise moment from F = Clockwise moment from rod's weight
   *F* × (0.500 m) = 0.75 Nm [M1]
   *F* = 0.75 / 0.500
   *F* = 1.5 N [A1]
   **Final Answer:** 1.5 N directed upwards.

### Standard Solution Steps
- Step 1: Draw a clear free-body diagram of the rod, showing all forces and their points of application.
- Step 2: Identify the pivot point. If not given, choose a convenient point to eliminate one of the unknown forces (e.g., the pivot point itself).
- Step 3: Identify which forces create clockwise moments and which create anticlockwise moments about the pivot.
- Step 4: Calculate the perpendicular distance from the line of action of each force to the pivot. Ensure all units are consistent (preferably SI units).
- Step 5: Apply the principle of moments: `Sum of clockwise moments = Sum of anticlockwise moments`.
- Step 6: Solve the resulting algebraic equation for the unknown quantity.

 

### Common Mistakes
- Confusing forces and moments; summing forces instead of moments about the pivot
- Using distances not taken from the pivot; ignoring the rod's own weight or using the wrong position
- Unit conversion errors (cm to m)
- Incorrect identification of clockwise vs anticlockwise moments

- **Remediation Path**: Use practical demonstrations with a ruler, pivot, and weights. Start with simple cases (uniform rod, pivot at the centre) and gradually add complexity. Insist on students drawing a full diagram with all forces and distances labelled before any calculation.

## Forces, density and pressure: Pressure in Fluids

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.4
**Learning Objective**: define and apply the concept of pressure; derive and apply the formula P = hρg for the pressure difference in a fluid

 

### Example Question
A sealed cylindrical tank contains two immiscible liquids, oil and water. The base of the tank has an area of 0.50 m². A layer of oil of thickness 60 cm rests on top of a layer of water of thickness 1.5 m.
- Density of oil, $\rho_{oil} = 850$ kg m⁻³
- Density of water, $\rho_{water} = 1000$ kg m⁻³
- Acceleration of free fall, $g = 9.81$ m s⁻²

(a) Define pressure.
(b) Calculate the pressure exerted by the oil on the water at the interface between the two liquids.
(c) Calculate the total pressure exerted by both liquids on the base of the tank.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
(a) Pressure is defined as the force acting normally (perpendicularly) per unit area. [B1]

(b) The pressure at the interface is due to the column of oil above it.
   Using the formula $P = h\rho g$: [C1]
   - Height of oil, $h_{oil} = 60$ cm $= 0.60$ m
   - Density of oil, $\rho_{oil} = 850$ kg m⁻³
   $P_{oil} = h_{oil} \times \rho_{oil} \times g$
   $P_{oil} = 0.60 \times 850 \times 9.81$ [M1]
   $P_{oil} = 5003.1$ Pa
   $P_{oil} \approx 5.0 \times 10^3$ Pa (or 5.0 kPa) [A1]

(c) The total pressure at the base is the sum of the pressure due to the oil and the pressure due to the water.
   **Step 1: Calculate pressure due to the water column.**
   - Height of water, $h_{water} = 1.5$ m
   - Density of water, $\rho_{water} = 1000$ kg m⁻³
   $P_{water} = h_{water} \times \rho_{water} \times g$
   $P_{water} = 1.5 \times 1000 \times 9.81 = 14715$ Pa [M1]

   **Step 2: Calculate total pressure.**
   $P_{total} = P_{oil} + P_{water}$ [M1]
   $P_{total} = 5003.1 + 14715 = 19718.1$ Pa
   $P_{total} \approx 2.0 \times 10^4$ Pa (or 20 kPa) [A1]
   *(Note: The area of the base is not needed for calculating pressure, but would be for calculating force. This is a common distractor.)*

### Standard Solution Steps
- Step 1: Recall the definition of pressure ($P = F/A$) and the formula for pressure in a fluid column ($P = h\rho g$).
- Step 2: For pressure at a certain depth, identify the height *h* of the fluid column(s) above that point.
- Step 3: Ensure all quantities are in SI base units (e.g., cm to m).
- Step 4: Calculate the pressure exerted by each layer of fluid separately using $P = h\rho g$.
- Step 5: To find the total pressure at a certain depth, sum the pressures from all fluid layers above that point. (If atmospheric pressure is to be included, it would also be added).

 

### Common Mistakes
- Thinking pressure depends on total volume rather than depth
- Forgetting to add pressures from upper fluid layers; using wrong densities
- Unit conversion errors (cm to m); mistakenly using base area in the pressure formula
- Confusing density and pressure formulas

- **Remediation Path**: Start with a single fluid to establish the `P = hρg` relationship. Use thought experiments like "Does a wider swimming pool have more pressure at the bottom than a narrow one of the same depth?" to solidify the concepts.

## Forces, density and pressure: Archimedes' Principle & Upthrust

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.4
**Learning Objective**: show an understanding of and apply Archimedes’ principle to solve problems

 

### Example Question
A rectangular block of wood has dimensions 10.0 cm × 20.0 cm × 5.0 cm and a mass of 0.70 kg. It is placed in a tank of sea water.
- Density of sea water, $\rho_{water} = 1030$ kg m⁻³
- Acceleration of free fall, $g = 9.81$ m s⁻²

(a) State Archimedes' principle.
(b) Calculate the density of the wood.
(c) By comparing the weight of the block to the maximum possible upthrust, determine whether the block will float or sink.
(d) If the block floats, calculate the height of the block that is submerged in the water.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
(a) Archimedes' principle states that the upthrust acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. [B1]

(b) **Calculate volume and density of wood:**
   Volume $V_{wood} = (0.100 \text{ m}) \times (0.200 \text{ m}) \times (0.050 \text{ m}) = 0.0010$ m³ [C1]
   Density $\rho_{wood} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.70 \text{ kg}}{0.0010 \text{ m³}} = 700$ kg m⁻³ [A1]

(c) **Compare forces:**
   **1. Weight of the block (downward force):**
      $W = mg = 0.70 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m s⁻²} = 6.867$ N [M1]
   **2. Maximum possible upthrust (upward force when fully submerged):**
      $U_{max} = \text{weight of displaced fluid} = \rho_{water} \times V_{wood} \times g$ [M1]
      $U_{max} = 1030 \text{ kg m⁻³} \times 0.0010 \text{ m³} \times 9.81 \text{ m s⁻²} = 10.10$ N [M1]
   **Conclusion:** Since the maximum upthrust (10.10 N) is greater than the weight of the block (6.87 N), the block will **float**. [A1]

(d) When floating, the object is in equilibrium, so `Upthrust = Weight`.
   Let $V_{sub}$ be the submerged volume.
   $U = \rho_{water} \times V_{sub} \times g = 6.867$ N [M1]
   $1030 \times V_{sub} \times 9.81 = 6.867$
   $V_{sub} = \frac{6.867}{1030 \times 9.81} = 6.797 \times 10^{-4}$ m³ [M1]

   Let *h* be the submerged height. The submerged volume is `Area × h`.
   Base area of block = $0.100 \text{ m} \times 0.200 \text{ m} = 0.020$ m²
   $V_{sub} = \text{Area} \times h$
   $6.797 \times 10^{-4} = 0.020 \times h$
   $h = \frac{6.797 \times 10^{-4}}{0.020} = 0.034$ m (or 3.4 cm) [A1]

### Standard Solution Steps
- Step 1: Calculate the weight of the object ($W = mg$). This is the constant downward force.
- Step 2: Calculate the total volume of the object.
- Step 3: Calculate the maximum possible upthrust by assuming the object is fully submerged. Use the formula $U_{max} = \rho_{fluid} \times V_{object} \times g$.
- Step 4: Compare the object's weight (W) with the maximum upthrust ($U_{max}$).
    - If $W > U_{max}$, the object sinks.
    - If $W \le U_{max}$, the object floats.
- Step 5: If the object floats, set the upthrust equal to the object's weight to find the volume of fluid it must displace to be in equilibrium.
- Step 6: Use the displaced volume to calculate the required property (e.g., submerged height or fraction of volume submerged).

 

### Common Mistakes
- **Error Patterns**:
    - **Conceptual_Misconception**: Using the density of the object instead of the density of the fluid when calculating upthrust. Confusing mass, weight, and density.
    - **Procedural_Error**: Calculating upthrust using the submerged volume when trying to find maximum upthrust.
    - **Application_Error**: Unit conversion errors are very common (e.g., cm³ to m³ is a factor of $10^6$, not $10^2$).
    - **Common_Mistakes**: Forgetting to set Upthrust equal to Weight for a floating object.

- **Remediation Path**: Begin by deriving upthrust from the pressure difference formula ($U = (P_{bottom} - P_{top}) \times A$). Use density comparisons as an initial intuitive check for whether an object will float. Emphasize that the "displaced fluid" is the key to calculating upthrust.

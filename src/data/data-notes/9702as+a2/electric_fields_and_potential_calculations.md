## A2 Level Topic 18: Electric fields

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.18
**Learning Objective**: Understand and use Coulomb's law in the form $F = \frac{Q_1Q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$, define and use electric field strength as the force per unit positive charge, and define and use electric potential as the work done per unit positive charge.

### Example Question
Two point charges, $Q_A = +4.0$ nC and $Q_B = -6.0$ nC, are placed in a vacuum. Charge $Q_A$ is at position $x=0$ and charge $Q_B$ is at $x = 8.0$ cm. Point P is on the line joining the two charges at position $x = 4.0$ cm.

(a) State Coulomb's law. [1]

(b) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the resultant electric field strength at point P. [4]

(c) Calculate the resultant electric potential at point P. [2]

(d) An electron is placed at rest at point P. State and explain the direction of the initial force on the electron. [2]

### Mark Scheme / Solution
(a)
The force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of their separation. [1]

(b)
Electric field due to $Q_A$ at P, $E_A = \frac{Q_A}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$
$E_A = \frac{4.0 \times 10^{-9}}{4\pi(8.85 \times 10^{-12})(0.040)^2} = 22470$ N C$^{-1}$ (to the right)
[M1] for calculation of one E-field value.

Electric field due to $Q_B$ at P, $E_B = \frac{Q_B}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$
$E_B = \frac{6.0 \times 10^{-9}}{4\pi(8.85 \times 10^{-12})(0.040)^2} = 33705$ N C$^{-1}$ (to the right, as field points towards a negative charge)
[M1] for calculation of second E-field value.

Both fields are in the same direction (to the right).
Resultant field $E_{total} = E_A + E_B = 22470 + 33705 = 56175$ N C$^{-1}$ [M1] for correct vector addition.
$E_{total} = 5.6 \times 10^4$ N C$^{-1}$ to the right (or in the positive x-direction). [A1]

(c)
Electric potential is a scalar, so sum potentials algebraically.
$V = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}$
Potential from $Q_A$, $V_A = \frac{4.0 \times 10^{-9}}{4\pi(8.85 \times 10^{-12})(0.040)} = +899$ V
Potential from $Q_B$, $V_B = \frac{-6.0 \times 10^{-9}}{4\pi(8.85 \times 10^{-12})(0.040)} = -1348$ V
[M1] for correct method, summing potentials with correct signs.

Resultant potential $V_{total} = V_A + V_B = 899 - 1348 = -449$ V
$V_{total} = -450$ V (2 s.f.) [A1]

(d)
The resultant electric field is directed to the right. [1]
The force on a negative charge (electron) is in the opposite direction to the electric field. Therefore, the force is to the left. [1]

### Standard Solution Steps
- Identify all given quantities (charges, distances) and ensure distances are converted to metres.
- To find resultant electric field strength, first calculate the field strength from each individual charge using $E = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$.
- Determine the direction of each electric field vector at the specified point (away from positive charges, towards negative charges).
- Add the electric field vectors (taking direction into account) to find the resultant field strength.
- To find resultant electric potential, calculate the potential from each individual charge using $V = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}$. Remember to include the sign of the charge.
- Add the scalar potential values algebraically to find the resultant potential.
- To determine the force on a charge $q$ placed at the point, use $F=qE$. The direction of the force is the same as the field for a positive charge and opposite to the field for a negative charge.

### Common Mistakes
- Vector/Scalar confusion: Incorrectly adding electric field strengths without considering their direction, or trying to assign a direction to potential.
- Sign errors: Forgetting to include the negative sign for potential due to a negative charge.
- Direction errors: Incorrectly identifying the direction of the electric field from a charge. Forgetting the convention that the direction of E is the direction of the force on a *positive* test charge.
- Unit errors: Failing to convert distances from cm to m before calculation.
- Formula confusion: Mixing up the formulas for field strength ($1/r^2$) and potential ($1/r$).

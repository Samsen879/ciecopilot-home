# Topic: Functions

## Subtopic: Domain and Range

### Definitions:
- Domain: The set of all possible input values (x-values) for which a function is defined.
- Range: The set of all possible output values (y-values) that a function can produce.

### Concepts:
- For a function $f(x)$, the domain is the set of values $x$ for which $f(x)$ is real and defined.
- The range is the set of values $f(x)$ takes for all $x$ in the domain.

### Skills:
- Determine the domain of a function, considering restrictions like division by zero or square roots of negative numbers.
- Determine the range of a function by analyzing its graph or algebraic properties.

### Typical Question Types:
- Find the domain and range of a given function.
- State the largest possible domain for which a function is defined.

### Example Question:
Find the domain and range of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x-2}$.

#### Mark Scheme/Solution:
- For the domain, $x-2 \ge 0$ (M1)
- So, $x \ge 2$. Domain: $[2, \infty)$ (A1)
- For the range, since $\sqrt{x-2} \ge 0$, the range is $[0, \infty)$ (A1)

# Topic: Quadratic Functions

## Subtopic: Completing the Square

### Definitions:
- Completing the square: A technique used to convert a quadratic expression of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ into the form $a(x-h)^2 + k$.

### Concepts:
- The vertex of the parabola $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$ is at $(h, k)$.
- The minimum or maximum value of the quadratic function is $k$.

### Skills:
- Convert a quadratic expression into the completed square form.
- Find the vertex and the minimum/maximum value of a quadratic function.

### Typical Question Types:
- Express a quadratic in the form $a(x-h)^2 + k$.
- Find the minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function and the value of $x$ at which it occurs.

### Example Question:
Express $x^2 - 6x + 11$ in the form $(x-h)^2 + k$.

#### Mark Scheme/Solution:
- $(x^2 - 6x) + 11$ (M1)
- $(x - 3)^2 - 3^2 + 11$ (M1)
- $(x - 3)^2 - 9 + 11$ (A1)
- $(x - 3)^2 + 2$ (A1)

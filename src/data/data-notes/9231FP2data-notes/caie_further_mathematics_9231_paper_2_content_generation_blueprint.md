### 1. Structured Syllabus Breakdown

The content generation must cover all learning objectives within the six core topics of the 9231 Paper 2 syllabus. The following table serves as a comprehensive checklist.

| Topic ID | Main Topic | Learning Objectives & Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1** | **Hyperbolic Functions** | - Understand definitions of `sinh x`, `cosh x`, `tanh x`, `sech x`, `cosech x`, `coth x` in terms of exponentials.<br>- Sketch the graphs of all hyperbolic functions.<br>- Prove and use identities corresponding to standard trigonometric identities (e.g., `cosh²x - sinh²x ≡ 1`).<br>- Understand and use definitions of inverse hyperbolic functions.<br>- Derive and use the logarithmic forms of inverse hyperbolic functions (e.g., `arsinh x = ln(x + √(x²+1))`). |
| **2.2** | **Matrices** | - Formulate and solve systems of 3 linear simultaneous equations using matrix equations (`Ax = b`).<br>- Analyze the consistency of systems of 3 linear equations (unique solution, no solution, infinitely many solutions).<br>- Relate consistency to the determinant of the matrix (`det(A)`).<br>- Interpret the solutions geometrically (intersection of three planes as a point, a line, or no common points/sheaf).<br>- Understand and find the characteristic equation, eigenvalues (`λ`), and eigenvectors (`e`) for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.<br>- Diagonalize a matrix: express `A` as `QDQ⁻¹`, where D is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and Q's columns are eigenvectors.<br>- Use diagonalization to find powers of matrices (e.g., `A³ = QD³Q⁻¹`).<br>- Apply the Cayley-Hamilton theorem: a matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. Use this to find powers or the inverse of a matrix. |
| **2.3** | **Differentiation** | - Differentiate hyperbolic functions and inverse hyperbolic functions (`arsinh x`, etc.).<br>- Differentiate inverse trigonometric functions (`arcsin x`, etc.).<br>- Find the second derivative (`d²y/dx²`) for implicitly or parametrically defined relations.<br>- Derive and use the first few terms of a Maclaurin's series for a function, including cases requiring implicit differentiation (e.g., for `y = tan x`). |
| **2.4** | **Integration** | - Integrate hyperbolic functions.<br>- Integrate functions of the form `1/√(a²-x²)`, `1/√(x²+a²)`, and `1/√(x²-a²)`, using trigonometric or hyperbolic substitutions.<br>- Derive and use reduction formulae for definite integrals (e.g., for ∫sinⁿx dx).<br>- Use rectangles to approximate the area under a curve, establishing bounds and deriving inequalities or limits concerning sums.<br>- Calculate arc lengths of curves in Cartesian, parametric, or polar coordinates.<br>- Calculate surface areas of revolution about an axis for curves in Cartesian or parametric form. |
| **2.5** | **Complex Numbers** | - Understand and prove de Moivre’s theorem for positive integer exponents.<br>- Use de Moivre’s theorem for rational exponents.<br>- Express trigonometric ratios of multiple angles in terms of powers of single angles (e.g., `cos(5θ)` in terms of `cos θ`).<br>- Express powers of `sin θ` and `cos θ` in terms of multiple angles (e.g., `sin⁶θ` in terms of `cos(2θ)`, `cos(4θ)`, etc.).<br>- Sum series using the `C + iS` method.<br>- Find and use the n-th roots of unity. |
| **2.6** | **Differential Equations** | - Solve first-order linear differential equations of the form `dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x)` using an integrating factor.<br>- Solve second-order linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (`ay'' + by' + cy = 0`).<br>- Solve second-order linear non-homogeneous equations (`ay'' + by' + cy = f(x)`) by finding the complementary function (CF) and a particular integral (PI).<br>- Find the PI for forms of `f(x)` including polynomials, exponentials (`keᵃˣ`), and sinusoids (`p cos(kx) + q sin(kx)`).<br>- Use a given substitution to reduce a differential equation to a solvable form (e.g., `x = eᵗ` for Euler-type equations, or `y = ux` for homogeneous equations).<br>- Apply initial conditions to find a particular solution. |

### 2. CAIE Style Guide

Analysis of past papers reveals a consistent and distinct "house style" for questions. All generated content must adhere to these principles.

*   **Command Words**: Phrasing is precise and formal. Key command words include:
    *   **Show that / Prove that**: The final answer is given. The candidate must provide a rigorous, step-by-step logical argument to derive it. Marks are awarded for the method, not the final answer.
    *   **Find / Determine / Calculate**: The candidate must derive a specific numerical answer or algebraic expression.
    *   **Hence / Deduce**: Use the result from the immediately preceding part of the question to find the next answer. No marks are awarded if the previous result is not used.
    *   **Use the substitution...**: A specific method is prescribed and must be followed.
    *   **Sketch**: A diagram is required. Key features (asymptotes, intercepts, turning points) must be clearly shown and labelled, but it does not need to be perfectly to scale.

*   **Question Structure**:
    *   **Scaffolding**: Questions are typically broken into parts (a), (b), (c), which build upon each other. Part (a) often involves proving a foundational result or identity that is required for part (b).
    *   **Mark Allocation**: The marks in brackets `[n]` indicate the expected amount of work. A `[2]` or `[3]` mark question is a short, direct application. A `[7]` to `[11]` mark question is a complex, multi-step problem covering an entire topic area (e.g., solving a full second-order differential equation with initial conditions).
    *   **Synoptic Links**: Questions frequently integrate concepts from different topics. For example, a question might use de Moivre's theorem from Complex Numbers to solve a polynomial equation, a skill linked to the Roots of Polynomials topic from Paper 1.

*   **Difficulty and Scope**:
    *   Questions test the fluent application of techniques.
    *   Unfamiliar problems require candidates to adapt known methods to new situations (e.g., using a non-standard substitution in a differential equation).
    *   Final answers are often required in a specific format (e.g., "in the form `ln(a + √b)` where a and b are integers").

### 3. Mark Scheme Specification

The CAIE marking system is methodical. Solutions must be generated with sufficient detail to allow for this style of mark allocation.

*   **Marking Codes**:
    *   `M1` (Method Mark): Awarded for applying a valid method to the problem. Minor numerical or algebraic slips do not prevent this mark from being awarded.
    *   `A1` (Accuracy Mark): Awarded for a correct answer or intermediate step. This mark is contingent on the associated method mark (`M1`) being earned.
    *   `B1` (Independent Mark): Awarded for a correct statement, result, or graph feature, independent of method marks.
    *   `DM1` or `dep*`: A dependent method mark, which can only be awarded if a previous specified `M` or `B` mark has been earned.
    *   `FT` (Follow Through): Allows a candidate to earn subsequent marks even if they made an earlier error. This is applied in specific scenarios only.

*   **Mark Allocation Principles**:
    *   **No "Show that" Answer Marks**: For questions asking to "Show that..." a given result is true, the final `A1` mark is for reaching the given answer correctly, but no marks are given for simply writing it down. All marks are for the intermediate working.
    *   **Unsupported Answers**: Correct answers obtained from a calculator without any supporting working shown will receive no marks. All relevant steps of the method must be demonstrated.
    *   **Partial Marks**: Marks are allocated for specific, correct steps in the solution. A student can earn `M` marks for a correct approach even if their final answer is wrong.

### Question

Find the particular solution of the differential equation
$$ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - 3\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 6e^{4x} $$
given that when $x=0$, $y=5$ and $\frac{dy}{dx}=7$.

[9]

### Solution

**1. Find the Complementary Function (CF):**

The auxiliary equation is $m^2 - 3m + 2 = 0$.
Factoring gives $(m-1)(m-2) = 0$, so the roots are $m=1$ and $m=2$.
The complementary function is $y_{CF} = Ae^x + Be^{2x}$.

**2. Find the Particular Integral (PI):**

The right-hand side is $6e^{4x}$. We try a particular integral of the form $y_{PI} = Ce^{4x}$.
Then $\frac{dy}{dx} = 4Ce^{4x}$ and $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 16Ce^{4x}$.

Substitute into the DE:
$16Ce^{4x} - 3(4Ce^{4x}) + 2(Ce^{4x}) = 6e^{4x}$
$16Ce^{4x} - 12Ce^{4x} + 2Ce^{4x} = 6e^{4x}$
$6Ce^{4x} = 6e^{4x}$
So, $6C = 6 \implies C=1$.

The particular integral is $y_{PI} = e^{4x}$.

**3. Form the General Solution:**

The general solution is $y = y_{CF} + y_{PI}$.
$y = Ae^x + Be^{2x} + e^{4x}$.

**4. Apply Initial Conditions:**

First, find $\frac{dy}{dx}$:
$\frac{dy}{dx} = Ae^x + 2Be^{2x} + 4e^{4x}$.

Now, use the initial conditions:
When $x=0$, $y=5$:
$5 = Ae^0 + Be^0 + e^0 \implies 5 = A + B + 1 \implies A+B=4$  (1)

When $x=0$, $\frac{dy}{dx}=7$:
$7 = Ae^0 + 2Be^0 + 4e^0 \implies 7 = A + 2B + 4 \implies A+2B=3$  (2)

Solving simultaneously:
(2) - (1): $B = -1$.
Substitute into (1): $A - 1 = 4 \implies A = 5$.

**5. State the Particular Solution:**

The particular solution is $y = 5e^x - e^{2x} + e^{4x}$.

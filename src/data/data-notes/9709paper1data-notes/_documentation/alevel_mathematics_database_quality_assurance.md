### **Quality Assurance Report: A-Level Mathematics Database**

**Report Date:** 7/5/2025
**Analyst:** QA Agent
**Status:** **NOT COMPLIANT**

---

### **Overall Assessment**

The document is **not compliant** with the required quality standards. While syllabus coverage and the inclusion of mark scheme codes are satisfactory, there are systemic failures in mathematical formatting, structural consistency, field integrity, and content formatting. The document appears to be a draft compiled from multiple sources with different formatting standards, resulting in widespread inconsistencies.

### **Detailed Findings by Rule**

#### **1. Syllabus Coverage**
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Finding:** All 8 major topics specified in the syllabus blueprint (Quadratics, Functions, Coordinate Geometry, Circular Measure, Trigonometry, Series, Differentiation, Integration) and their primary subtopics are present in the document.

#### **2. Math Formatting**
- **Status:** **FAIL**
- **Finding:** There is a systemic failure to enclose mathematical expressions, variables, and formulas in single dollar signs (`$...$`). This issue is present across all topics.
- **Specific Errors:**
    - **Topic: Quadratics, Subtopic: 1.1:** The function definition `f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 23` and the general form `a(x + b)^2 + c` are not enclosed in dollar signs.
    - **Topic: Quadratics, Subtopic: 1.2:** The discriminant formula `b^2 - 4ac` and its related inequalities (`> 0`, `= 0`, `< 0`) are formatted as plain text.
    - **Topic: Functions, Subtopic: One-one and Inverse Functions:** Inverse function notation like `f⁻¹(x)` and the relationship `y = f(x)` are not correctly formatted.
    - **Topic: Coordinate Geometry, Key Formulas:** The distance formula `d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}` and the circle equation `(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2` are not formatted.
    - **Topic: Circular Measure, Key Formulas:** The core formulas `s = r\theta` and `A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta` are not formatted.
    - **Topic: Differentiation, 7.1:** The derivative rule `\frac{dy}{dx} = nx^{n-1}` is formatted as plain text.

#### **3. Field Formatting**
- **Status:** **FAIL**
- **Finding:** There are multiple instances of disallowed formatting (bold, italics) within field values. This is also inconsistent across the document.
- **Specific Errors:**
    - **Topic: Circular Measure, Key Formulas:** In the table, the condition `**radians**` is bolded within a cell value, violating the rule.
    - **Topic: Circular Measure, Exam-Style Question 3, Solution:** The CAIE mark codes (`[B1]`, `[M1]`, etc.) are bolded (`**[B1]**`), while they are not bolded in other sections like Quadratics.
    - **Topic: Trigonometry, Example Question (Graph):** The CAIE mark codes (`[M1]`, `[A1]`, etc.) are inconsistently bolded.
    - **Topic: Coordinate Geometry, Equation of a Circle:** The solution contains italicized notes, e.g., `*Note: The question implies two points...*`, which violates the rule against using italics within field values.

#### **4. List Formatting**
- **Status:** **PASS (with reservations)**
- **Finding:** In all entries where the fields 'Standard Solution Steps', 'Common Mistakes', and 'Tags' are present, they correctly use Markdown dash lists (`- ...`). However, many entries use different field names (e.g., 'Solution', 'Detailed Solution') and different list formats (e.g., numbered lists), which is a structural failure noted under Rule 6.

#### **5. Field Integrity**
- **Status:** **FAIL**
- **Finding:** Many entries are missing required fields from the template established in the Quadratics section. Several topics are formatted as prose rather than structured data entries.
- **Specific Errors:**
    - **Topic: Functions, Subtopic: Composite Functions:** The `Key Formulas` field is missing.
    - **Topic: Coordinate Geometry:** All entries are missing the `Mark Scheme` field.
    - **Topic: Circular Measure:** Entries lack a standardized structure and are missing `Common Mistakes`, `Tags`, and `Mark Scheme` fields for each example.
    - **Topic: Differentiation:** All entries are missing the `Mark Scheme` field.
    - **Topic: Integration:** Entries lack the standard per-example field structure entirely.

#### **6. Structural Consistency**
- **Status:** **FAIL**
- **Finding:** The document's structure is highly inconsistent. At least four different templates are used across the eight topics, violating the requirement for identical heading structure and field order.
- **Specific Errors:**
    - **Inconsistency between topics:** The structure for **Quadratics** and **Series** is consistent but differs significantly from **Functions**, **Coordinate Geometry**, **Circular Measure**, **Trigonometry**, **Differentiation**, and **Integration**.
    - **Inconsistency within a topic:** The **Functions** topic uses multiple structures; some entries contain a `Key Formulas` field while others do not, and some contain both `Detailed Solution` and `Standard Solution Steps` fields.
    - **Field Name Variance:** Field names are inconsistent (e.g., `Example Question` vs. `Question`, `Mark Scheme` vs. `Solution` vs. `Detailed Solution`).

#### **7. Mark Scheme Compliance**
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Finding:** All example questions include inline CAIE-style mark codes (`M1`, `A1`, `B1`, etc.) within their respective solution or mark scheme sections.

### **Actionable Recommendations**

To achieve compliance, a full document re-formatting is required:
1.  **Standardize Structure:** Adopt the template used in the **Quadratics** section as the single standard for all example question entries across all topics.
2.  **Enforce Math Formatting:** Perform a global find-and-replace and manual check to ensure ALL mathematical content is wrapped in single dollar signs (`$...$`).
3.  **Correct Field Content:** Remove all bold and italic formatting from within field values.
4.  **Ensure Field Integrity:** Add all missing fields (`Key Formulas`, `Mark Scheme`, etc.) to non-compliant entries.
5.  **Unify List Formats:** Ensure all solution steps are presented in a consistent format (dash list) under the `Standard Solution Steps` field.

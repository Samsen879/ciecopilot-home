### **4.1 Continuous random variables**
- **Learning Objectives:** Candidates should be able to:
    - Use a probability density function which may be defined piecewise.
    - Use the general result E(g(X)) = ∫g(x)f(x)dx where f(x) is the probability density function of the continuous random variable X and g(X) is a function of X.
    - Understand and use the relationship between the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF), and use either to evaluate probabilities or percentiles.
    - Use cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of related variables in simple cases (e.g., given the CDF of X, find the CDF of Y=X³).

### **4.2 Inference using normal and t-distributions**
- **Learning Objectives:** Candidates should be able to:
    - Formulate hypotheses and apply a hypothesis test concerning the population mean using a small sample drawn from a normal population of unknown variance, using a t-test.
    - Calculate a pooled estimate of a population variance from two samples.
    - Formulate hypotheses concerning the difference of population means, and apply, as appropriate:
        - a 2-sample t-test
        - a paired sample t-test
        - a test using a normal distribution
    - Determine a confidence interval for a population mean, based on a small sample from a normal population with unknown variance, using a t-distribution.
    - Determine a confidence interval for a difference of population means, using a t-distribution or a normal distribution, as appropriate.

### **4.3 χ²-tests**
- **Learning Objectives:** Candidates should be able to:
    - Fit a theoretical distribution, as prescribed by a given hypothesis, to given data.
    - Use a χ²-test, with the appropriate number of degrees of freedom, to carry out the corresponding goodness of fit analysis (classes should be combined so that each expected frequency is at least 5).
    - Use a χ²-test, with the appropriate number of degrees of freedom, for independence in a contingency table (Yates’ correction is not required; rows or columns should be combined so that the expected frequency in each cell is at least 5).

### **4.4 Non-parametric tests**
- **Learning Objectives:** Candidates should be able to:
    - Understand the idea of a non-parametric test and appreciate situations in which such a test might be useful (e.g., when sampling from a population which cannot be assumed to be normally distributed).
    - Understand the basis of the sign test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (including knowledge that Wilcoxon tests are valid only for symmetrical distributions).
    - Use a single-sample sign test and a single-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test a hypothesis concerning a population median (including the use of normal approximations where appropriate; questions will not involve tied ranks or observations equal to the population median value being tested).
    - Use a paired-sample sign test, a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate, to test for identity of populations (including the use of normal approximations where appropriate; questions will not involve tied ranks or zero-difference pairs).

### **4.5 Probability generating functions**
- **Learning Objectives:** Candidates should be able to:
    - Understand the concept of a probability generating function (PGF) and construct and use the PGF for given distributions (including the discrete uniform, binomial, geometric, and Poisson distributions).
    - Use formulae for the mean and variance of a discrete random variable in terms of its PGF, and use these formulae to calculate the mean and variance of a given probability distribution.
    - Use the result that the PGF of the sum of independent random variables is the product of the PGFs of those random variables.

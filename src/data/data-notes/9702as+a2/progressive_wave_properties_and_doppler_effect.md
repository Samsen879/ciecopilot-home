## Waves: Progressive Wave Properties

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.7
**Learning Objective**: Define and use displacement, amplitude, phase difference, period, frequency, wavelength, speed; distinguish longitudinal vs transverse; apply $v=f\lambda$.

### Example Question

(a) State the key distinction between a longitudinal wave and a transverse wave, with reference to the direction of oscillation and the direction of energy transfer. [2]

(b) A sound wave travels through air with a speed of 340 m s⁻¹. The wave has a frequency of 2.5 kHz.
   (i) Calculate the wavelength of the sound wave. [2]
   (ii) Sound is a longitudinal wave. Describe the motion of an air particle as the wave passes. [1]

---
### Mark Scheme / Solution

**(a)**
- **M1**: In a transverse wave, oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. In a longitudinal wave, oscillations are parallel to the direction of energy transfer. [1]
- **A1**: Both directions (oscillation and energy transfer) must be correctly linked for both wave types to get the mark. [1]
  > *Example of a correct statement: For a longitudinal wave, the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction the wave travels, whereas for a transverse wave, they oscillate at right angles.*

**(b)**
**(i)**
- **C1**: Correct use of the wave equation `v = fλ`, rearranged to `λ = v / f`. [1]
  - Must show conversion of frequency: `f = 2.5 kHz = 2500 Hz`.
- **A1**: `λ = 340 / 2500 = 0.136 m`. Correct final answer with unit. [1]

**(ii)**
- **M1**: The air particle oscillates back and forth *parallel* to the direction of the wave's travel, about a fixed equilibrium position. [1]

### Standard Solution Steps

- Part (a): Recall the definitions of longitudinal and transverse waves and compare oscillation direction vs energy transfer direction.
- Part (b)(i):
  - Identify the given quantities and convert frequency to Hz.
  - Use the wave equation $v=f\lambda$ and solve for wavelength $\lambda=v/f$.
  - Substitute the values and calculate the result.
- Part (b)(ii): Apply the longitudinal wave definition to describe an air particle's motion parallel to propagation.

### Common Mistakes

- Treating oscillation vs energy transfer directions incorrectly for wave type identification
- Forgetting to convert kHz to Hz before applying $\lambda=v/f$
- Describing particle motion as travelling with the wave instead of oscillating about equilibrium

## Waves: Doppler Effect for Sound

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.7
**Learning Objective**: Use $ f_o = \frac{f_s v}{v \pm v_s} $ for sound; explain Doppler effect qualitatively.

### Example Question

An ambulance has a siren that emits a sound of a constant frequency of 850 Hz. The ambulance travels along a straight road at a constant speed of 25.0 m s⁻¹. A stationary observer stands by the side of the road. The speed of sound in the air is 340 m s⁻¹.

(a) Calculate the frequency of the sound heard by the observer as the ambulance approaches. [2]
(b) Calculate the frequency of the sound heard by the observer as the ambulance moves away after passing them. [2]
(c) Explain qualitatively why the observed frequency is higher as the ambulance approaches. [2]

### Mark Scheme / Solution

**(a)**
- **C1**: Correct selection of the Doppler formula with the minus sign for an approaching source: $ f_o = \frac{f_s v}{v - v_s} $. [1]
- **A1**: Correct substitution and calculation: $ f_o = \frac{850 \times 340}{340 - 25.0} = \frac{289000}{315} = 917.5 $ Hz. Answer to 3 or 4 s.f. (e.g., 918 Hz). [1]

**(b)**
- **C1**: Correct selection of the Doppler formula with the plus sign for a receding source: $ f_o = \frac{f_s v}{v + v_s} $. [1]
- **A1**: Correct substitution and calculation: $ f_o = \frac{850 \times 340}{340 + 25.0} = \frac{289000}{365} = 791.8 $ Hz. Answer to 3 or 4 s.f. (e.g., 792 Hz). [1]

**(c)**
- **M1**: As the source moves towards the observer, the emitted wavefronts are closer together / the effective wavelength is decreased. [1]
- **A1**: Since wave speed `v` is constant, and `v = fλ`, a decrease in wavelength `λ` results in an increase in the observed frequency `f`. [1]

### Standard Solution Steps

1.  **Identify variables**: Write down all known values: `fs = 850 Hz`, `v = 340 m s⁻¹`, `vs = 25.0 m s⁻¹`.
2.  **Part (a) - Approaching**:
    - Recall the rule: when the source approaches, the observed frequency increases, so the denominator in the formula must be smaller. Choose the minus sign: `v - vs`.
    - Substitute the values into $ f_o = \frac{f_s v}{v - v_s} $ and compute the result.
3.  **Part (b) - Receding**:
    - Recall the rule: when the source moves away, the observed frequency decreases, so the denominator must be larger. Choose the plus sign: `v + vs`.
    - Substitute the values into $ f_o = \frac{f_s v}{v + v_s} $ and compute the result.
4.  **Part (c) - Explanation**:
    - Think about the wavefronts. Visualize the source "catching up" to the waves it emits in the forward direction.
    - State that this motion compresses the wavefronts, reducing the wavelength.
    - Connect the reduced wavelength back to frequency using the wave equation `v = fλ`.

### Common Mistakes

- **Key_Concept**: The Doppler effect is a change in observed frequency due to the *relative motion* between a wave source and an observer. The core physical reason is the "bunching" or "stretching" of wavefronts.
- **Alternative_Approach**: Use diagrams showing concentric circles (wavefronts) emitted by a source.
    - **Stationary source**: The circles are evenly spaced.
    - **Moving source**: The circles are bunched up in the direction of motion and spread out behind it. This visual aid makes the concept of changing wavelength intuitive.
- **Mnemonic**:
    - "Towards gives Tiny wavelength" (and thus higher frequency).
    - "Away gives Ample wavelength" (and thus lower frequency).
- **Emphasis**: The source frequency `fs` does not change. The change is only for the *observer*.

## Waves: Polarisation

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.7
**Learning Objective**: Recognise polarisation as a property of transverse waves; describe demonstrations with light or microwaves.

### Example Question

(a) Explain why light waves can be polarised but sound waves cannot. [2]

(b) Unpolarised light is passed through two polarising filters, P1 and P2. The polarising axis of P2 is oriented at 90° to the axis of P1. Describe and explain the observations of the light intensity:
   (i) after passing through P1. [2]
   (ii) after passing through P2. [1]

---
### Mark Scheme / Solution

**(a)**
- **M1**: Polarisation is the restriction of wave oscillations to a single plane. This is only possible for transverse waves, where oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. Light is a transverse wave. [1]
- **A1**: Sound is a longitudinal wave, where oscillations are parallel to the direction of energy transfer. There is no perpendicular component to restrict, so it cannot be polarised. [1]

**(b)**
**(i)**
- **M1**: After passing through P1, the light becomes plane-polarised. [1]
- **A1**: The intensity of the light is halved. This is because the unpolarised light has components in all planes, and the polariser only transmits the component of oscillations parallel to its axis. [1]

**(ii)**
- **M1**: After passing through P2 (the analyser), the intensity is zero / no light is observed. This is because P2's axis is at 90° to the polarised light from P1, and it blocks all remaining oscillations. [1]

### Standard Solution Steps

1.  **Part (a):**
    - Start by defining polarisation: restricting oscillations to a single plane.
    - State that this property is exclusive to transverse waves.
    - Identify light as a transverse wave, hence it can be polarised.
    - Identify sound as a longitudinal wave, and explain why its parallel oscillations cannot be restricted in this way.
2.  **Part (b)(i):**
    - Describe the function of the first polariser (P1): it acts as a 'polariser'.
    - State its effect on unpolarised light: it selects one plane of vibration, making the light plane-polarised.
    - Explain the intensity change. Average over all angles: half the intensity passes through.
3.  **Part (b)(ii):**
    - Describe the function of the second polariser (P2): it acts as an 'analyser'.
    - Consider the light entering P2: it is already polarised in one direction (the axis of P1).
    - Since P2's axis is perpendicular (90°) to this incoming polarised light, no component of the light can pass through. The light is completely blocked.

### Common Mistakes

- **Key_Concept**: Polarisation is the definitive test for a transverse wave. If a wave can be polarised, it *must* be transverse.
- **Analogy**: Use the "rope and picket fence" analogy.
    - A rope (the medium) is threaded through two picket fences (the polarisers).
    - Shaking the rope up and down (vertical polarisation) allows the wave to pass through a vertical fence.
    - If the second fence is horizontal (crossed polarisers), the wave is blocked.
    - Trying to send a push-pull longitudinal wave down the rope shows that the fences have no effect, illustrating why longitudinal waves cannot be polarised.
- **Demonstration**: Use two actual polarising filters and a light source (like a phone screen or overhead projector). Show that rotating one filter reduces the light, and at 90° (crossed), it blocks the light completely. This is a very powerful and convincing demonstration.

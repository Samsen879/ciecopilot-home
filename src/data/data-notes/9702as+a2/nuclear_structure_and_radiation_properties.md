## Particle Physics: Rutherford Scattering, Atomic Model and Radiation Properties

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.11
**Learning Objective**: Describe evidence for the nuclear model from α-scattering; define nucleon/proton numbers and isotopes; compare properties of α, β⁻ and γ radiation.

### Example Question

**(a)** The Rutherford α-particle scattering experiment provided evidence for the nuclear model of the atom.
  (i) State two observations from this experiment. [2]
  (ii) Explain how one observation in (a)(i) leads to a conclusion about atomic structure. [2]

**(b)** A neutral atom of $\,^{235}_{92}\!U$.
  (i) State the numbers of protons, neutrons and electrons. [3]
  (ii) Define the term isotope. [2]

**(c)** State two differences between α-particles and β⁻-particles. [2]

### Mark Scheme / Solution

**(a)(i)** Most α pass straight through with little/no deflection (A1); a very small fraction are deflected through large angles/back-scattered (A1).

**(a)(ii)** Link observation to conclusion and explain (M1,A1), e.g. “Most pass straight through” → atom is mostly empty space; “Few large deflections” → small, dense, positively charged nucleus causing strong electrostatic repulsion for large-angle scattering.

**(b)(i)** Protons: 92 (A1); Neutrons: 235 − 92 = 143 (A1); Electrons: 92 (A1).

**(b)(ii)** Isotopes are nuclides of the same element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. (M1,A1)

**(c)** Any two valid differences (A1×2), e.g. charge (+2e vs −e), mass (much larger for α), penetration (α less penetrating), ionisation (α more ionising), magnetic/electric deflection (α less deflected), energy spectrum (α discrete, β continuous).

### Standard Solution Steps
- Recall key observations from Geiger–Marsden (undeflected majority; rare large-angle deflections).
- Translate observations into conclusions about empty space and a small, dense, positive nucleus.
- Interpret nuclide notation $\,^{A}_{Z}\!X$; compute P/N/E for a neutral atom.
- Recall radiation properties and compare α vs β⁻ across charge, mass, penetration, ionisation, deflection.

### Common Mistakes
- Stating conclusions as observations; failing to link observation → conclusion.
- Mixing nucleon and neutron numbers; omitting the electron count for neutrality.
- Vague or incorrect α vs β⁻ comparisons; missing that β⁻ has continuous energies.

## Particle Physics: Quark Model, Leptons and β Decay

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.11
**Learning Objective**: Describe the simple quark model (uud, udd); identify leptons; describe β⁻ decay in quark terms and apply charge conservation.

### Example Question

**(a)** State the quark composition of a proton and show that the neutron’s quark composition gives zero total charge. [3]

**(b)** Name one lepton other than the electron. [1]

**(c)** In β⁻ decay, a down quark transforms: $ d \rightarrow u + X + Y $.
  (i) Identify particle X. [1]
  (ii) Identify antiparticle Y. [1]
  (iii) Show how charge conservation is satisfied. [2]

### Mark Scheme / Solution

**(a)** Proton: uud (A1). Neutron: udd (M1). Charge sum: $+\tfrac{2}{3}e - \tfrac{1}{3}e - \tfrac{1}{3}e = 0$ (A1).

**(b)** Any of: muon, tau, electron/muon/tau neutrino (A1).

**(c)(i)** X is an electron/β⁻ (A1). (ii) Y is an electron antineutrino $\overline{\nu}_e$ (A1).

**(c)(iii)** Initial charge (d): $-\tfrac{1}{3}e$ (M1). Final: $+\tfrac{2}{3}e - 1e + 0 = -\tfrac{1}{3}e$ (A1); charges match, so conserved.

### Standard Solution Steps
- Recall uud/udd and quark charges; perform explicit charge sums.
- List lepton family members (excluding antiparticles).
- Write β⁻ decay at particle and quark levels; verify charge conservation by summing charges on both sides.

### Common Mistakes
- Mixing uud and udd, or summing charges incorrectly.
- Naming hadrons/antiparticles as leptons; omitting “anti-” for antineutrino.
- Not explicitly summing charges when arguing conservation.

- **Total: [2]**

### Standard Solution Steps

**Part (a)(i)**
1.  Recall the key findings of the Geiger-Marsden experiment.
2.  State the most common result: The vast majority of α-particles were undeflected.
3.  State the rare but crucial result: A tiny fraction of α-particles were deflected at large angles.

**Part (a)(ii)**
1.  **Choose one observation:** For example, "Most α-particles passed straight through."
2.  **Form a conclusion:** This observation implies that there is nothing in their path to deflect them. Therefore, the atom must consist mainly of empty space.
3.  **Explain the link:** The small, massive nucleus must occupy a tiny volume within the atom, leaving the rest of the atomic volume empty.
4.  **Alternative:** Choose the other observation: "A few α-particles were deflected by large angles."
5.  **Form a conclusion:** A large deflection requires a very strong force. This implies the atom's positive charge and mass are concentrated in a small, dense region (the nucleus).
6.  **Explain the link:** The electrostatic force of repulsion between the positive α-particle and the positive nucleus is responsible for the scattering. For this force to be strong enough for back-scattering, the charge must be highly concentrated.

**Part (b)(i)**
1.  **Interpret the notation $ _{Z}^{A}X $**:
    -   *A* (superscript) is the nucleon number (protons + neutrons). A = 235.
    -   *Z* (subscript) is the proton number. Z = 92.
2.  **Number of protons:** This is directly given by Z, which is 92.
3.  **Number of neutrons:** This is A - Z. Neutrons = 235 - 92 = 143.
4.  **Number of electrons:** For a neutral atom, the number of electrons must equal the number of protons to balance the charge. Electrons = 92.

**Part (b)(ii)**
1.  **Start with the element:** Isotopes relate to a single element, meaning the chemical identity is the same. This is determined by the proton number. So, they have the *same number of protons*.
2.  **Identify the difference:** The mass is different (different nucleon number). Since the proton number is the same, the *number of neutrons must be different*.

**Part (c)**
1.  Systematically compare the fundamental properties of α and β⁻ particles.
2.  **Charge:** α is positive (+2e), β⁻ is negative (-e). This is one difference.
3.  **Mass:** α is a helium nucleus (~4u), β⁻ is an electron (~1/1840 u). α is much more massive. This is a second difference.
4.  Other possible comparisons include penetrating power (α is low, β⁻ is medium) and ionising ability (α is high, β⁻ is medium).

### Common Mistakes

-   **Confusing Observations and Conclusions:** A very common error is to state a conclusion (e.g., "the atom is mostly empty space") as an observation.
    -   **Correction:** An observation is what was directly seen (e.g., flashes on the screen showing particles passed through). A conclusion is the inference drawn from that observation.
-   **Vague Explanations:** In (a)(ii), simply stating "the positive nucleus repels the positive alpha particle" is not enough. The key is to link the *large angle* of deflection to the *concentration* of charge and mass in a small nucleus.
-   **Mixing Nucleon and Neutron Number:** In (b)(i), students might state that the neutron number is 235.
    -   **Correction:** Remember that the top number (A) is the **nucleon** number (total protons AND neutrons). You must subtract the proton number (Z) to find the neutron number.
-   **Incomplete Definition of Isotope:** Stating only "different number of neutrons" is insufficient. The definition must also include what is the *same* (the number of protons).

- **Total: [2]**

### Standard Solution Steps

**Part (a)(i)**
1.  Recall the standard model composition of a proton. It consists of two up quarks and one down quark.

**Part (a)(ii)**
1.  First, state the required quark composition for a neutron: one up quark, two down quarks (udd).
2.  Sum the charges of these constituent quarks using the given values.
3.  Calculation: Charge = (charge of u) + (charge of d) + (charge of d)
    = (+⅔*e*) + (–⅓*e*) + (–⅓*e*)
    = (+⅔*e*) – (⅔*e*) = 0.
4.  Conclude that the total charge is zero, as required for a neutron.

**Part (b)**
1.  Recall the six leptons in the standard model. They are the electron, muon, tau, and their corresponding neutrinos.
2.  Name any one of them other than the electron. The most common answers are 'muon' or 'electron neutrino'.

**Part (c)(i)**
1.  Analyze the full β⁻ decay equation: $ n \rightarrow p + e⁻ + \overline{ν}_e $.
2.  The question shows the underlying quark process: $ d \rightarrow u $.
3.  This change from a down quark (in the neutron) to an up quark (in the proton) is what constitutes the β⁻ decay.
4.  The emitted particles are an electron (β⁻ particle) and an electron antineutrino. Therefore, particle X, the charged particle emitted, must be the electron.

**Part (c)(ii)**
1.  From the full decay equation in step (c)(i), the other emitted particle, Y, is the electron antineutrino.
2.  The key is to remember that in β⁻ decay, an *anti*neutrino is produced to conserve lepton number.

**Part (c)(iii)**
1.  Apply the law of conservation of charge to the quark transformation equation: $ d \rightarrow u + X + Y $.
2.  **Initial Charge (LHS):** The charge of a down (d) quark is –⅓*e*.
3.  **Final Charge (RHS):**
    -   Charge of up (u) quark = +⅔*e*.
    -   Charge of particle X (electron) = –1*e*.
    -   Charge of particle Y (antineutrino) = 0.
4.  **Sum the final charges:** (+⅔*e*) + (–*e*) + 0 = (+⅔*e*) – (³⁄₃*e*) = –⅓*e*.
5.  **Compare:** The initial charge (–⅓*e*) equals the final charge (–⅓*e*). Therefore, charge is conserved.

### Common Mistakes

-   **Incorrect Quark Compositions:** Students frequently mix up the compositions of the proton (uud) and neutron (udd).
    -   **Correction:** A useful mnemonic is to associate the particle's name with the quark that is in the majority. **N**eutron has more **d**ow**n** quarks. **P**roton is the other one. Also, checking that the charges sum correctly (+1e for proton, 0 for neutron) is a vital self-check.
-   **Confusing Leptons and Hadrons:** Students may incorrectly name a hadron (like a pion) or an anti-lepton (like a positron) as a lepton.
    -   **Correction:** Clearly memorize the two main families: Hadrons (made of quarks, e.g., protons, neutrons) and Leptons (fundamental, e.g., electron, muon, neutrinos).
-   **Mixing up Particles and Antiparticles:** In (c)(ii), naming Y as a "neutrino" instead of an "antineutrino" is a common mistake.
    -   **Correction:** Remember the conservation rule: β⁻ decay (electron produced) is paired with an *anti*neutrino. β⁺ decay (positron produced) is paired with a *neutrino*.
-   **Charge Conservation Error:** In (c)(iii), students may forget to include the charge of the electron (X) in their calculation, or use the incorrect quark charges.
    -   **Correction:** Write out the full equation with all product particles. Systematically substitute the charge for *every* particle on both sides of the arrow before summing. Double-check that you are using –⅓*e* for down and +⅔*e* for up.

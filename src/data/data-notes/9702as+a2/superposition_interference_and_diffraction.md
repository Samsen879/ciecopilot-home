## Superposition: Two-Source Interference

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.8
**Learning Objective**: State superposition, define interference and coherence, give conditions for two-source fringes, and apply $x = \tfrac{\lambda D}{a}$.

---
### Example Question

A laser producing monochromatic light of wavelength 630 nm illuminates two parallel slits. An interference pattern is observed on a screen placed 1.5 m from the slits. The distance between the centers of the slits is 0.45 mm.

(a) State the principle of superposition. [1]

(b) State two conditions necessary for a stable and clear interference pattern to be formed by the two slits. [2]

(c) Calculate the separation of adjacent bright fringes on the screen. [3]

(d) The separation of the slits is now decreased. State and explain the effect this has on the appearance of the fringes. [2]

### Mark Scheme / Solution

**(a)**
- **B1**: When two or more waves meet at a point, the resultant displacement is the vector sum of the individual displacements of the waves. [1]

**(b)**
- **B1**: The sources must be coherent (or have a constant phase difference). [1]
- **B1**: The waves must have approximately the same amplitude. (Also accept: waves must be of the same type/polarisation). [1]

**(c)**
- **C1**: Correct conversion of units: $\lambda = 630 \times 10^{-9}$ m and $a = 0.45 \times 10^{-3}$ m. [1]
- **C1**: Correct application of the formula $x = \frac{\lambda D}{a}$. [1]
- **A1**: $x = \frac{(630 \times 10^{-9}) \times 1.5}{0.45 \times 10^{-3}} = 2.1 \times 10^{-3}$ m (or 2.1 mm). [1]

**(d)**
- **M1**: The fringe separation increases / the fringes become more spread out. [1]
- **A1**: From the relationship $x = \frac{\lambda D}{a}$, fringe separation $x$ is inversely proportional to slit separation $a$. As $a$ decreases, $x$ increases. [1]

---
### Standard Solution Steps
- **Part (a):** Recall the formal definition of superposition (resultant displacement is the vector sum).
- **Part (b):** State conditions for interference; coherence is essential, similar amplitudes improve contrast.
- **Part (c):** List knowns ($\lambda, D, a$), convert to SI, substitute into $x = \tfrac{\lambda D}{a}$ and compute.
- **Part (d):** Use inverse proportionality between $x$ and $a$ to explain fringe spacing change.

---
### Common Mistakes
- Mixing diffraction conditions with interference conditions (e.g., citing slit width instead of coherence).
- Failing to convert nm/mm to metres.
- Inverting or misplacing variables in $x = \tfrac{\lambda D}{a}$.
- Vague statements about pattern change without specifying wider/narrower and why.

## Superposition: Diffraction Grating

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.8
**Learning Objective**: Apply $d\sin\theta=n\lambda$; use a grating to determine wavelength; reason about maximum observable order.

### Example Question

A beam of monochromatic light is incident normally on a diffraction grating. The grating has 500 lines per mm. A second-order maximum is observed at an angle of 35.0° to the direction of the incident light.

(a) Calculate the wavelength of the light. [3]

(b) Determine the maximum number of orders of maxima that can be observed with this grating and this wavelength of light. [3]

---
### Mark Scheme / Solution

**(a)**
- **C1**: Correctly calculate the grating spacing $d$. $d = \frac{1}{500 \text{ lines/mm}} = 2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m/line. Or $d = \frac{1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}}{500} = 2.0 \times 10^{-6}$ m. [1]
- **C1**: Correctly substitute values into the grating equation $d \sin\theta = n\lambda$ with $n=2$. [1]
- **A1**: $\lambda = \frac{d \sin\theta}{n} = \frac{(2.0 \times 10^{-6}) \times \sin(35.0^\circ)}{2} = 5.74 \times 10^{-7}$ m (or 574 nm). [1]

**(b)**
- **M1**: The maximum possible angle for a maximum is $\theta = 90^\circ$, so $\sin\theta = 1$. [1]
- **C1**: Use $d \sin\theta = n\lambda$ with $\sin\theta = 1 \implies n = \frac{d}{\lambda}$.
   $n = \frac{2.0 \times 10^{-6}}{5.74 \times 10^{-7}} = 3.48...$ [1]
- **A1**: Since $n$ must be an integer, the maximum order is 3. [1]

---
### Standard Solution Steps
- **Part (a):** Compute slit spacing $d$ from lines/mm; convert to metres. Identify $n$ and $\theta$, rearrange $d\sin\theta=n\lambda$ for $\lambda$, substitute and calculate.
- **Part (b):** Use $\sin\theta\le 1$ so $n_{max}=\lfloor d/\lambda \rfloor$.

---
### Common Mistakes
- Getting $d$ wrong by not inverting lines/mm or not converting mm to m.
- Rounding $n_{max}$ up instead of down.
- Calculator in radians when degrees are needed.

## Superposition: Stationary Waves

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.8
**Learning Objective**: Describe formation of stationary waves; define node and antinode; carry out typical calculations for wavelength and speed.

### Example Question

A string is stretched between two fixed points P and Q. The string is made to vibrate, forming a stationary wave. The pattern at one instant is shown below.

Diagram: A stationary wave on a string with fixed ends P and Q, showing 3 full loops (antinodes). There are 4 nodes and 3 antinodes; P and Q are nodes at the ends.

The distance between P and Q is 90.0 cm. The frequency of the vibration is 120 Hz.

(a) Explain how the stationary wave is formed on the string. [2]
(b) Define a node and an antinode. [2]
(c) Determine the wavelength of the waves on the string. [2]
(d) Calculate the speed of the progressive waves that formed the stationary wave. [2]

---
### Mark Scheme / Solution

**(a)**
- **M1**: A progressive wave travels down the string and reflects at a fixed end (Q). [1]
- **A1**: The reflected wave interferes/superposes with the incident wave (travelling in the opposite direction) to produce a stationary wave. [1]

**(b)**
- **B1**: A node is a point of zero amplitude / minimum displacement. [1]
- **B1**: An antinode is a point of maximum amplitude / maximum displacement. [1]

**(c)**
- **M1**: The diagram shows 3 'loops' or 3/2 wavelengths fitting into the length of the string. So, $L = \frac{3}{2}\lambda$. [1]
- **A1**: $\lambda = \frac{2 \times L}{3} = \frac{2 \times 90.0 \text{ cm}}{3} = 60.0$ cm (or 0.600 m). [1]

**(d)**
- **C1**: Correct use of the wave equation $v = f\lambda$. [1]
- **A1**: $v = 120 \times 0.600 = 72.0$ m s⁻¹. (Must use wavelength in metres). [1]

---
### Standard Solution Steps
- **Part (a):** State that two counter-propagating waves of the same frequency superpose to form a stationary wave (by reflection).
- **Part (b):** Define node (zero amplitude) and antinode (maximum amplitude).
- **Part (c):** From the diagram, relate $L$ to $\lambda$; each loop is $\lambda/2$, so with 3 loops $L=3\lambda/2$ and hence $\lambda=2L/3$.
- **Part (d):** Use $v=f\lambda$ with SI units.

---
### Common Mistakes
- Assuming a stationary wave transfers energy like a progressive wave.
- Taking $\lambda=L$ instead of using loop counting for harmonics.
- Forgetting unit conversion before using $v=f\lambda$.

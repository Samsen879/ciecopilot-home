## Waves: Progressive Wave Graph Interpretation

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.7

**Learning Objective**: Interpret wave graphs to determine amplitude, wavelength, speed and phase difference.

### Example Question
The graph shows displacement against distance for a transverse progressive wave at an instant. The frequency is 50 Hz.

(a) Determine the amplitude. [1]

(b) Determine the wavelength. [1]

(c) Calculate the wave speed. [2]

(d) Find the phase difference, in radians, between points at x = 0.25 m and x = 0.60 m. [2]

### Mark Scheme / Solution
- Amplitude is the maximum displacement from equilibrium; reading from the graph gives 4.0 mm (A1)
- One full cycle spans 1.0 m along x; wavelength λ = 1.0 m (A1)
- v = fλ = 50 × 1.0 = 50 m s⁻¹ (M1, A1)
- Δx = 0.35 m; ϕ = 2πΔx/λ = 2π × 0.35 = 0.70π rad ≈ 2.2 rad (M1, A1)

### Standard Solution Steps
- Read amplitude and wavelength directly from a single cycle of the graph.
- Use v = fλ to find speed from frequency and wavelength.
- Use ϕ = 2πΔx/λ to convert a path difference to phase difference.

### Common Mistakes
- Taking peak-to-trough as amplitude instead of half that value.
- Mixing degrees and radians when reporting phase.
- Using an incorrect Δx or λ when applying ϕ = 2πΔx/λ.

## Waves: Doppler Effect for a Moving Source

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.7

**Learning Objective**: Apply the Doppler formula for a source moving relative to a stationary observer.

### Example Question
A police car moves at 30 m s⁻¹ towards a stationary observer. Its siren emits 850 Hz. Speed of sound is 340 m s⁻¹.

(a) State and explain whether the observed frequency is greater or smaller than 850 Hz. [2]

(b) Calculate the observed frequency. [2]

### Mark Scheme / Solution
- Approaching source compresses wavefronts → shorter period → higher frequency (B1, B1)
- fo = fs × v/(v − vs) = 850 × 340/(340 − 30) = 850 × 340/310 = 930 Hz (M1, A1)

### Standard Solution Steps
- Choose the correct sign in fo = fs v/(v ± vs) based on approach or recession.
- Substitute consistent SI values and evaluate.

### Common Mistakes
- Using the plus sign for an approaching source.
- Confusing sound speed v with source speed vs.

## Waves: Polarisation and Malus Law

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.7

**Learning Objective**: Use Malus law for intensity through polarisers and explain why only transverse waves polarise.

### Example Question
Unpolarised light of intensity I_in passes P1 then P2. The angle between axes is 60°.

(a) Define a transverse wave. [1]

(b) Explain why sound cannot be polarised. [1]

(c) Determine the transmitted intensity through P2 in terms of I_in. [3]

### Mark Scheme / Solution
- Transverse: oscillations perpendicular to energy transfer direction (B1)
- Sound is longitudinal with oscillations parallel to travel; no plane of oscillation to restrict (B1)
- After P1: I1 = 1/2 I_in; After P2: I2 = I1 cos²θ = (1/2 I_in) × cos²60° = 1/8 I_in (M1, C1, A1)

### Standard Solution Steps
- Halve unpolarised intensity at first polariser.
- Apply Malus law with the angle between transmission axes.

### Common Mistakes
- Forgetting the initial halving before applying Malus law.
- Using cos θ instead of cos² θ.

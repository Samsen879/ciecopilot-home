## Circular Motion: Horizontal Circle Kinematics

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.12
**Learning Objective**: Use radians, angular displacement/velocity; apply $a=v^2/r=r\omega^2$ and $F=mv^2/r=mr\omega^2$.

### Example Question

A small toy car of mass 150 g moves in a horizontal circle of radius 45 cm. The car completes 5.0 revolutions in 2.0 s.

 (a) Calculate the angular velocity, $\omega$, of the car in rad s⁻¹.
 (b) Calculate the linear speed, $v$, of the car.
 (c) Calculate the centripetal force required.

### Mark Scheme / Solution

- $T=2.0/5.0=0.40$ s or $f=2.5$ Hz; $\omega=2\pi/T=15.7$ rad s⁻¹. (C1,M1,A1)
- $v=r\omega=0.45\times15.7=7.1$ m s⁻¹ (M1,A1)
- $F=mr\omega^2=0.150\times0.45\times15.7^2\approx17$ N (M1,A1)

---

### Standard Solution Steps

- Find $f$ or $T$, compute $\omega=2\pi f$.
- Convert cm→m; compute $v=r\omega$.
- Use $F=mr\omega^2$ (or $F=mv^2/r$) with SI units.

---

### Common Mistakes

- Not converting g→kg or cm→m; degrees vs radians; forgetting the squared term.

## Circular Motion: Banked Track without Friction

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.12
**Learning Objective**: Resolve forces on a banked track; show $F_c=mg\tan\theta$ and find speed.

### Example Question

A car of mass 1100 kg travels at a constant speed around a circular, banked track of radius 95 m. The track is banked at an angle of 18° to the horizontal, as shown in the diagram.

![A diagram showing a car on a banked track. The angle of the bank is 18 degrees to the horizontal. Forces acting on the car are its weight (W) acting vertically downwards and the normal reaction force (R) acting perpendicular to the track surface.](https://i.imgur.com/gK1Vz3X.png)

At one particular speed *v*, the car can travel around the track without any reliance on a sideways frictional force.

 (a) Explain why the horizontal component of the normal reaction provides the centripetal force.
 (b) By resolving forces, determine the centripetal force.
 (c) Calculate the speed $v$ of the car.

### Mark Scheme / Solution

**(a)(i)**
- **Weight (W or mg)** drawn vertically downwards from the car's centre of mass.
- **Normal Reaction (R or N)** drawn perpendicular to the banked surface, pointing away from it. **(A1)**
  *(Both forces must be present and correctly oriented for the mark)*

- **Total: [1]**

**(a)(ii)**
- The car is not accelerating vertically, so the vertical forces must be balanced. **(M1)**
- The resultant/net force is the vector sum of all forces. The vertical components cancel, leaving only the horizontal component of the normal reaction. This net force acts towards the centre of the circle and provides the centripetal force. **(A1)**

- **Total: [2]**

**(b)**
- Vertical: $R\cos18^\circ=mg$; horizontal: $F_c=R\sin18^\circ$; hence $F_c=mg\tan18^\circ\approx3.5\,\text{kN}$. (C1,C1,A1)

- **Total: [3]**

**(c)**
- Formula F_c = mv²/r used. **(M1)**
- Rearranging and substituting: v = √(F_c * r / m) = √(3500 N * 95 m / 1100 kg) = 17.4 m s⁻¹. **(A1)**
  *(Allow consequential error from (b). Accept 17 m s⁻¹)*

- **Total: [2]**

### Standard Solution Steps

- Draw FBD; resolve vertical and horizontal components.
- Use $R\cos\theta=mg$, $F_c=R\sin\theta$; eliminate $R$ to get $F_c=mg\tan\theta$.
- Apply $F_c=mv^2/r$ to find $v$.

**Part (b)**
1.  **Set up equilibrium equations:**
    -   Horizontally, the net force is the centripetal force: F_c = R sin 18°.
    -   Vertically, the net force is zero: R cos 18° = W = mg.
2.  **Solve for R:** From the vertical equation, R = mg / cos 18°.
3.  **Substitute to find F_c:** Substitute the expression for R into the horizontal equation:
    F_c = (mg / cos 18°) * sin 18°.
4.  **Simplify:** Since sin θ / cos θ = tan θ, the expression simplifies to F_c = mg tan 18°.
5.  **Calculate:** F_c = 1100 * 9.81 * tan 18° ≈ 3503 N. Round to two significant figures, giving 3500 N.

**Part (c)**
1.  **Recall the formula:** The centripetal force is related to speed by F_c = mv²/r.
2.  **Rearrange for speed (v):**
    v² = F_c * r / m
    v = √(F_c * r / m)
3.  **Substitute known values:** Use the value of F_c from part (b).
    v = √(3503 N * 95 m / 1100 kg) ≈ 17.4 m s⁻¹.

### Common Mistakes

- Drawing $R$ vertically; swapping sin/cos; assuming $R=mg$ on a bank.

## Gravitational Fields: Force and Field Strength in Orbit

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.13

**Learning Objective**: Apply Newton’s law of gravitation to find force and field strength at orbital altitudes.

### Example Question
A 580 kg satellite orbits the Earth at altitude 5.50 × 10⁵ m. Earth: M = 5.98 × 10²⁴ kg, R = 6.37 × 10⁶ m. G = 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N m² kg⁻².

(a) State Newton’s law of gravitation. [2]

(b) Calculate the gravitational force on the satellite. [3]

(c) Determine the gravitational field strength at the satellite. [2]

---

### Mark Scheme / Solution
- Law: Force ∝ product of masses and ∝ 1/r²; or F = Gm₁m₂/r² with terms defined (M1, A1)
- r = R + h = 6.37 × 10⁶ + 5.50 × 10⁵ = 6.92 × 10⁶ m; F = GMm/r² = 4.83 × 10³ N (C1, M1, A1)
- g = F/m = 8.33 N kg⁻¹ (or g = GM/r²) (M1, A1)

---

### Standard Solution Steps
- Sum Earth’s radius and altitude to get centre-to-centre separation r.
- Substitute into F = GMm/r²; evaluate carefully with scientific notation.
- Use g = F/m or g = GM/r² to find field strength.

---

### Common Mistakes
- Using altitude or Earth’s radius alone for r instead of R + h.
- Forgetting to square r in the denominator.

## Gravitational Fields: Potential and Work Done Between Orbits

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.13

**Learning Objective**: Use φ = −GM/r and ΔEₚ = mΔφ to compute energy changes and work.

### Example Question
A 1200 kg probe moves from r₁ = 7.00 × 10⁶ m to r₂ = 1.50 × 10⁷ m around Earth (M = 5.98 × 10²⁴ kg, G as above).

(a) Define gravitational potential at a point. [2]

(b) Calculate Δφ between r₁ and r₂. [3]

(c) Find the minimum work required by the engines. [3]

---

### Mark Scheme / Solution
- Potential is work done per unit mass in bringing a mass from infinity to the point (M1, A1)
- φ = −GM/r; φ₁ = −5.70 × 10⁷ J kg⁻¹; φ₂ = −2.66 × 10⁷ J kg⁻¹; Δφ = +3.04 × 10⁷ J kg⁻¹ (M1, C1, A1)
- W = mΔφ = 1200 × 3.04 × 10⁷ = 3.65 × 10¹⁰ J (M1, A1)

- **Total: [3]**

---

### Standard Solution Steps
- Write φ = −GM/r and evaluate at each radius.
- Subtract final − initial to get Δφ (less negative at larger r).
- Multiply by mass to get work/energy change.

---

### Common Mistakes
- Dropping the minus sign in φ causing wrong Δφ sign.
- Forgetting to multiply Δφ by mass to convert to joules.

### **Quality Assurance Final Report**
**Report Date:** 8/6/2025
**Subject:** Final Compliance Review of CAIE Physics 9702 Syllabus Content (Topics 1-25)

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

**Conclusion: FAIL**

The final review of the 25 topics has concluded that the documents are **not 100% compliant** with the specified formatting rules.

Systemic errors were identified across all topics, primarily violating rules concerning header format, text formatting (use of bold), field structure, and LaTeX delimiters. A full revision is required to correct these issues before the content can be approved.

### **2. Detailed Error Analysis**

The following table provides a precise list of all non-compliance issues, categorized by the violated rule.

| Rule Violated | Description of Error | Specific Examples and Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Header Format** | The required format `## [Topic]: [Subtopic]` is not used. All headers lack the mandatory square brackets `[]`. | **All 25 Topics**. For example:<br>- `## Gravitational fields: Geostationary Orbits`<br>- `## Physical Quantities and Units: Homogeneity and Graphical Analysis` |
| **2. No Extra Formatting** | Unauthorized bold (`**...**`) formatting is used for field names and sub-headings in every topic. | **Systemic Error (All 25 Topics):**<br>- `**Syllabus Reference**`<br>- `**Learning Objective**`<br><br>**Additional Instances:**<br>- **Topic "Magnetic fields: Motion of Charged Particles":** `**Shape**` and `**Explanation**` are bolded in the mark scheme.<br>- **Topic "Particle Physics: The Nuclear Atom and Quarks":** `**Setup**`, `**Observations**`, and `**Conclusions**` are bolded. |
| **3. Field Integrity** | The required flat field structure is not present. Sections from "Example Question" onwards are incorrectly formatted as level-3 headers (`###`) instead of being plain-text fields. | **All 25 Topics**. The structure incorrectly uses:<br>- `### Example Question`<br>- `### Mark Scheme / Solution`<br>- `### Standard Solution Steps`<br>- `### Common Mistakes`<br>- `### Tags` |
| **4. LaTeX Delimiters** | Several mathematical equations are not enclosed in the required single dollar sign (`$...$`) delimiters. | **Identified Errors:**<br>- **Topic "Ideal gases: Gas Laws and Kinetic Theory":** The equation `p = \frac{1}{3}\frac{Nm}{V}\langle c^2 \rangle` is not delimited in the `Learning Objective` or the `Example Question`.<br>- **Topic "Physical Quantities and Units: Homogeneity and Graphical Analysis":** The equations `T = kL^p g^q` and `T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{g} L` are not delimited. |
| **5. Tag Format** | **No errors found.** This is the only rule that is fully compliant across all 25 topics. | N/A |

### **3. Final Verdict**

The documentation fails the quality assurance check. The content cannot be approved in its current state.

**Required Action:** The documents must be returned for correction. All listed errors must be rectified to ensure full compliance with the established standards before resubmitting for a final review.

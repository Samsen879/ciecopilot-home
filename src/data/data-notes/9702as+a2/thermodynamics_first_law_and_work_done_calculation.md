## Thermodynamics: First Law and Work Done

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.16
**Learning Objective**: Apply the first law of thermodynamics to solve problems involving changes in internal energy, heat, and work.

### Example Question
An ideal gas is contained within a cylinder fitted with a piston. The gas expands at a constant pressure of $1.5 \times 10^5$ Pa from an initial volume of $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$ to a final volume of $5.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$. During this expansion, the gas is supplied with $1200$ J of thermal energy.

Calculate the change in internal energy of the gas.

### Mark Scheme / Solution
-   Calculation of the change in volume: $\Delta V = (5.0 \times 10^{-3}) - (2.0 \times 10^{-3}) = 3.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$. (C1)
-   Use of the formula for work done on the gas: $W = -p\Delta V$. (M1)
-   Correct substitution and calculation of work done: $W = -(1.5 \times 10^5) \times (3.0 \times 10^{-3}) = -450$ J. (C1)
-   Recall and use of the first law of thermodynamics: $\Delta U = Q + W$. (M1)
-   Correct substitution into the first law: $\Delta U = (+1200) + (-450)$. (C1)
-   Correct final answer for the change in internal energy: $\Delta U = +750$ J. (A1)

### Standard Solution Steps
- List given $p, V_1, V_2, Q$ and compute $\Delta V$
- Use $W=-p\Delta V$; note $W<0$ for expansion
- Apply $\Delta U=Q+W$ and compute result with signs

### Common Mistakes
-   **Sign Convention for Work Done ($W$):** The most common error is using the wrong sign for $W$. In the convention $\Delta U = Q + W$, $W$ is the work done *on* the system. When a gas expands, it does work on the surroundings, so the work done *on* the gas is negative. For compression, $W$ is positive.
-   **Sign Convention for Heat ($Q$):** Forgetting that heat supplied *to* the system is positive ($Q>0$) and heat lost *from* the system is negative ($Q<0$).
-   **Formula for Work Done:** Using $W = p\Delta V$ instead of $W = -p\Delta V$, which results in a sign error for the work done term.
-   **Unit Conversions:** Failing to convert volume to the SI unit of m$^3$ if it is given in cm$^3$ or litres. ($1$ m$^3 = 10^6$ cm$^3 = 1000$ litres).
-   **Interpreting the Question:** Confusing 'work done *by* the gas' with 'work done *on* the gas'. The work done *by* the gas is equal to $-W$.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on building a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) evaluation system for the CIE Copilot platform. The system will create repeatable evaluation datasets, implement quantitative metrics, and provide optimization recommendations to improve retrieval performance. The evaluation will focus on Physics (9702) content and use existing retrieval infrastructure while building evaluation capabilities on top.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build a comprehensive evaluation dataset from existing Physics content, so that I can systematically measure RAG retrieval performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating evaluation queries THEN the system SHALL create 30-50 queries derived from 9702 titles, sections, and learning objectives
2. WHEN creating ground truth labels THEN the system SHALL provide human-annotated top-5 relevant documents (qrels) for each query
3. WHEN storing evaluation data THEN the system SHALL save queries in queries.jsonl format and relevance judgments in qrels.jsonl format
4. IF a query has multiple relevant documents THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance score (1-3 scale)
5. WHEN generating queries THEN the system SHALL cover different query types including direct questions, concept explanations, and problem-solving scenarios

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement automated batch evaluation with standard IR metrics, so that I can quantify current RAG performance and track improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running batch evaluation THEN the system SHALL execute all queries against the existing RAG system using rag_search_demo.js
2. WHEN calculating metrics THEN the system SHALL compute Recall@1, Recall@3, Recall@5, MRR@5, and NDCG@5
3. WHEN processing results THEN the system SHALL handle cases where fewer than k documents are returned
4. IF evaluation completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with metric breakdowns
5. WHEN running evaluation THEN the system SHALL not modify existing retrieval code (rag_search_demo.js, search.js)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform systematic error analysis on retrieval failures, so that I can identify specific improvement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing failures THEN the system SHALL categorize errors into "recall missing" vs "ranking bias" types
2. WHEN identifying problem patterns THEN the system SHALL detect issues with term variants, synonyms, abbreviations, and cross-chapter references
3. WHEN generating error reports THEN the system SHALL provide top 10 failure cases with detailed analysis
4. IF recall failures occur THEN the system SHALL identify which relevant documents were not retrieved
5. WHEN ranking failures occur THEN the system SHALL show correct vs actual ranking positions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement and test optimization strategies through proof-of-concept implementations, so that I can validate improvement approaches before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing query rewrite THEN the system SHALL expand queries with term normalization and synonym expansion
2. WHEN testing hybrid retrieval THEN the system SHALL combine vector search with keyword filtering on titles and sections
3. WHEN implementing reranking THEN the system SHALL provide small-sample comparison with baseline results
4. IF optimization is tested THEN the system SHALL measure performance impact using the same evaluation metrics
5. WHEN running POC tests THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing architecture without production changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive actionable recommendations with quantified benefits, so that I can prioritize and implement the most effective optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluation completes THEN the system SHALL provide comparative analysis of baseline vs optimization approaches
2. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL specify implementation priority and expected impact
3. WHEN proposing deployment strategy THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with current architecture
4. IF multiple optimizations are available THEN the system SHALL recommend phased rollout approach
5. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL include specific next steps for first-phase implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable evaluation infrastructure, so that I can continuously monitor and improve RAG performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating evaluation scripts THEN the system SHALL provide one-click evaluation execution
2. WHEN building evaluation tools THEN the system SHALL support easy addition of new queries and ground truth data
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create reproducible evaluation results
4. IF evaluation dataset grows THEN the system SHALL handle scaling without architectural changes
5. WHEN evaluation runs THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation from production retrieval systems

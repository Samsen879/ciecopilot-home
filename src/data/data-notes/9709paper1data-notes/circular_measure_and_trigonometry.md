## Circular Measure: Radian Measure and Conversion
**Syllabus Reference**: 4.1
**Learning Objective**: Understand the definition of a radian and convert between radians and degrees.
### Example Question
(a) Convert $135°$ to radians, giving your answer as a multiple of $\pi$. [1]
(b) Convert $\frac{5\pi}{12}$ radians to degrees. [1]
### Mark Scheme / Solution
(a) To convert degrees to radians, we use the conversion factor.
$135° = 135 \times \frac{\pi}{180}$ radians. (M1 for using conversion factor)
$= \frac{3 \times 45}{4 \times 45} \pi = \frac{3\pi}{4}$ radians. (A1 for correct answer)

(b) To convert radians to degrees, we use the inverse conversion factor.
$\frac{5\pi}{12}$ radians $= \frac{5\pi}{12} \times \frac{180}{\pi}$ degrees. (M1 for using conversion factor)
$= \frac{5 \times 180}{12} = 5 \times 15 = 75°$. (A1 for correct answer)

Note: In P1, if a question involves angles and does not specify units, radians are implied.
### Standard Solution Steps
- To convert degrees to radians, multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180}$
- To convert radians to degrees, multiply by $\frac{180}{\pi}$
- Simplify fractions by canceling common factors
- Express answers as exact multiples of $\pi$ when possible
### Common Mistakes
- Forgetting the conversion factor between degrees and radians
- Using the wrong conversion factor (multiplying instead of dividing or vice versa)
- Not simplifying fractions properly
- Giving decimal approximations when exact answers are required

## Circular Measure: Arc Length and Sector Area
**Syllabus Reference**: 4.2
**Learning Objective**: Use the formulas for arc length ($s = r\theta$) and area of a sector ($A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$).
### Example Question
The diagram shows a sector $OAB$ of a circle with centre $O$ and radius $8$ cm. The angle $AOB$ is $72°$.
(a) Find the arc length $AB$. [2]
(b) Find the area of the sector $OAB$. [2]
### Mark Scheme / Solution
First, convert the angle from degrees to radians.
$\theta = 72° = 72 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{2\pi}{5}$ radians. (B1 for correct conversion)

(a) Arc Length
Using the formula $s = r\theta$:
$s = 8 \times \frac{2\pi}{5} = \frac{16\pi}{5}$ cm. (M1 for using arc length formula)
$s \approx 10.05$ cm (to 3 s.f.). (A1 for correct answer)
Either the exact answer in terms of $\pi$ or the decimal approximation is accepted unless specified otherwise.

(b) Area of Sector
Using the formula $A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$:
$A = \frac{1}{2} \times 8^2 \times \frac{2\pi}{5} = \frac{1}{2} \times 64 \times \frac{2\pi}{5}$ (M1 for using sector area formula)
$A = \frac{64\pi}{5}$ cm². (A1 for correct answer)
$A \approx 40.2$ cm² (to 3 s.f.).
### Standard Solution Steps
- Convert angle to radians if given in degrees
- Use $s = r\theta$ for arc length where $\theta$ is in radians
- Use $A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$ for sector area where $\theta$ is in radians
- Give answers in exact form or as specified in the question
### Common Mistakes
- Using degrees instead of radians in the formulas
- Forgetting to convert angle units before applying formulas
- Using incorrect formulas (mixing up arc length and area formulas)
- Calculation errors with fractions and $\pi$

## Circular Measure: Segments and Composite Shapes
**Syllabus Reference**: 4.3
**Learning Objective**: Solve problems involving the arc length and sector area of a circle, often including finding the area or perimeter of a segment or complex shapes made from sectors and triangles.
### Example Question
The diagram shows a sector $OPQ$ of a circle with centre $O$ and radius $12$ cm. The angle $POQ$ is $1.5$ radians. A point $R$ lies on the arc $PQ$ such that the angle $POR = 0.9$ radians. The chord $PR$ is drawn.
(a) Find the perimeter of the shaded region bounded by the chord $PR$ and the arc $RQ$. [4]
(b) Find the area of the shaded region bounded by the chord $PR$ and the arc $RQ$. [4]
### Mark Scheme / Solution
(a) Perimeter of the shaded region

Find the length of arc RQ:
The angle $ROQ$ is $1.5 - 0.9 = 0.6$ radians. (B1)
Arc length $RQ = r\theta = 12 \times 0.6 = 7.2$ cm. (M1)

Find the length of chord PR:
In triangle $OPR$, we know $OP = OR = 12$ cm and angle $POR = 0.9$ rad. Using the cosine rule:
$PR^2 = OP^2 + OR^2 - 2(OP)(OR)\cos(0.9)$
$PR^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 - 2(12)(12)\cos(0.9)$ (M1)
$PR^2 = 288 - 288\cos(0.9) = 288(1 - \cos(0.9))$
$PR^2 \approx 288(1 - 0.6216) = 288(0.3784) \approx 109.0$
$PR = \sqrt{109.0} \approx 10.44$ cm.

Calculate the total perimeter:
Perimeter = Arc $RQ$ + Chord $PR = 7.2 + 10.44 = 17.64$ cm.
Perimeter = $17.6$ cm (to 3 s.f.). (A1)

(b) Area of the shaded region

Find the area of sector ORQ:
Area = $\frac{1}{2}r^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}(12^2)(0.6) = \frac{1}{2}(144)(0.6) = 43.2$ cm². (M1)

Find the area of the segment formed by chord PR:
This is Area of Sector $OPR$ - Area of Triangle $OPR$.
Area of Sector $OPR = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}(12^2)(0.9) = 72(0.9) = 64.8$ cm². (M1)
Area of Triangle $OPR = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C = \frac{1}{2}(12)(12)\sin(0.9) = 72\sin(0.9)$
$= 72 \times 0.7833 \approx 56.40$ cm². (M1)
Area of Segment $PR = 64.8 - 56.40 = 8.40$ cm².

Calculate the total shaded area:
Total Area = Area of Sector $ORQ$ + Area of Segment $PR = 43.2 + 8.40 = 51.6$ cm². (A1)
### Standard Solution Steps
- Break complex shapes into simpler components (sectors, triangles, segments)
- Use appropriate formulas for each component
- Apply cosine rule for chord lengths when needed
- Calculate segment area as sector area minus triangle area
- Add or subtract areas as required by the problem
### Common Mistakes
- Not identifying all components of a composite shape
- Using wrong formulas for different parts of the shape
- Errors in applying cosine rule for chord calculations
- Adding instead of subtracting when finding segment areas
- Calculation errors with trigonometric values

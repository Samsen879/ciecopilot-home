# Project Plan: A-Level Mathematics 9709 P1 Question Database

---

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Resource Gathering**

*   **Objective:** To compile all foundational materials required for the comprehensive creation of the question database, ensuring complete alignment with the CAIE 9709 P1 curriculum.

*   **Required Resources:**
    1.  **Official CAIE 9709 P1 Syllabus:** The primary document to define the scope and ensure 100% coverage of all topics, sub-topics, and learning objectives.
    2.  **User-Provided Detailed Notes:** A collection of notes from various platforms, which will serve as a secondary reference for concepts, theorems, and common question types.
    3.  **Recent P1 Past Paper Questions:** A corpus of official exam questions to be used as a reference for question style, logical structure, difficulty, and mark scheme conventions.

### **Phase 2: Analysis & Scaffolding**

*   **Objective:** To deconstruct the gathered resources and establish a detailed structural blueprint that will guide the content generation process.

*   **Analytical Steps:**
    1.  **Syllabus Decomposition:** Systematically analyze the official 9709 P1 syllabus to extract a definitive, hierarchical list of all required topics and sub-topics (e.g., Quadratics, Functions, Coordinate Geometry, Circular Measure, Trigonometry, Series, Differentiation, Integration).
    2.  **Past Paper Categorization:** Analyze the provided past paper questions. As per the project requirements, each question will be meticulously mapped to its corresponding topic and sub-topic from the syllabus. This step is critical for understanding how concepts are tested in practice.
    3.  **Master Checklist Synthesis:** Synthesize the findings from the syllabus, user notes, and categorized past papers into a single, exhaustive **master checklist**. This checklist will enumerate every individual knowledge point, skill, and technique that must be covered in the final database.

### **Phase 3: Iterative Content Generation**

*   **Objective:** To systematically generate high-quality, original, and syllabus-aligned content for the entire P1 database, adhering strictly to the specified format.

*   **Process Description:**
    -   Content will be generated in a modular fashion. For each of the **8 major P1 topics**, a dedicated Markdown document will be created.
    -   Within each document, a series of original, exam-style questions will be authored. Each question will be accompanied by a detailed, step-by-step solution formatted in the official CAIE style, complete with mark allocations (e.g., M1, A1, B1).
    -   The generation process will be driven by the **master checklist** from Phase 2. Every single learning objective and skill on the checklist will be represented by at least one question in the database, ensuring 100% content coverage.
    -   All generated content will strictly conform to the user-specified Markdown template. Mathematical notation will be exclusively formatted using LaTeX (`$...$`).

### **Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Final Delivery**

*   **Objective:** To conduct a rigorous review and validation of the entire question database, ensuring it meets all 'Ultra-Strict' rules for accuracy, formatting, and completeness.

*   **Verification Checklist:**
    1.  **Syllabus Coverage Audit:** Cross-reference the final set of questions against the master checklist to confirm that 100% of the syllabus has been addressed.
    2.  **LaTeX Formatting Check:** Programmatically and manually scan all documents to ensure every mathematical expression, variable, and formula is correctly enclosed in LaTeX dollars (`$...$`) and renders correctly.
    3.  **Template Conformance Validation:** Verify that every Markdown file adheres precisely to the required template, including the exact field names, field order, and structural integrity for future JSON conversion.
    4.  **Content Accuracy Review:** Scrutinize all solutions and mark schemes for mathematical accuracy, logical consistency, and adherence to CAIE marking principles.

### **Next Steps**

Upon approval of this project plan, the immediate next action will be to **formally request the user-provided 'detailed notes' and 'past paper questions'** to initiate Phase 1.

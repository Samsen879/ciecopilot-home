## 1. Introduction & Core Concepts

### What is [Core Concept]?
[Provide a concise, intuitive definition. Explain *why* this concept is important and where it fits in the broader mathematical landscape. Start with a guiding question.]
> **Key Idea:** A single, powerful sentence summarizing the main takeaway.

### Foundational Principles
[Use a bulleted list to break down the concept into its fundamental rules, properties, or components. Use LaTeX for all mathematical notation.]
*   **Principle 1:** [Description of the first principle.]
    $$ [LaTeX_Formula_Example: z = a + bi] $$
*   **Principle 2:** [Description of the second principle.]
    $$ [LaTeX_Formula_Example: i^2 = -1] $$

---

## 2. Worked Example: Applying the Concepts

### Problem Statement
**Question:** [State a clear, exam-style question that targets the learning objectives.]

### Analytical Approach & Solution
[Provide a detailed, step-by-step solution. Each step should include both the mathematical operation and a clear explanation of the reasoning behind it.]

1.  **Identify the Goal:** [Explain what the question is asking for and the initial strategy.]
    *   *Calculation:*
        $$ [Step_1_LaTeX] $$
2.  **Apply Core Principle:** [Explain which concept or formula is being used and why.]
    *   *Calculation:*
        $$ [Step_2_LaTeX] $$
3.  **Simplify and Conclude:** [Show the final steps of simplification and state the answer clearly.]
    *   *Calculation:*
        $$ [Step_3_LaTeX] $$

**Final Answer:** The final, simplified answer is:
$$ [Final_Answer_LaTeX] $$

## 3. Examiner Insight & Strategy

### Examiner Tip
[Provide actionable advice, common pitfalls to avoid, or strategic shortcuts relevant to an exam context. Frame it as direct advice to the student.]
> *Example: "Always check if your final answer is in the required format (e.g., Cartesian form `a + bi`). Diagrams are not just for loci questions; a quick sketch can prevent sign errors in argument calculations."*

# --- ANALYTICAL & ADAPTIVE METADATA ---

## Difficulty Profile
*   **Overall Difficulty Score:** [1-5, where 1=Easy, 5=Hard]
*   **Conceptual Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High] - *Difficulty of understanding the abstract concepts involved.*
*   **Procedural Fluency Required:** [Low/Medium/High] - *Complexity and length of the required calculations.*
*   **Problem-Solving Demand:** [Low/Medium/High] - *Requirement for strategic thinking and linking multiple concepts.*

## Cognitive Skills Assessment
*   **Knowledge & Comprehension:** [Describe what a student must recall and understand. e.g., "Recall the definition of `i` and the structure of a complex number."]
*   **Application & Analysis:** [Describe how a student must apply and analyze information. e.g., "Apply the rules of algebraic multiplication, substituting `i^2 = -1` where appropriate."]
*   **Synthesis & Evaluation:** [Describe any higher-order thinking required. e.g., "Evaluate the most efficient method (e.g., conjugate multiplication vs. direct expansion) to solve the problem."]

## Common Misconceptions & Error Analysis
*   **Misconception 1:** [Describe a common student error. e.g., "Forgetting that `(bi)^2` equals `b^2 * i^2`, which is `-b^2`, not `b^2`."]
    *   **Corrective Feedback:** [Provide a clear, targeted explanation to correct the misunderstanding.]
*   **Misconception 2:** [e.g., "Adding real and imaginary parts incorrectly, such as `(2+3i) + (1+4i) = 2+7i`."]
    *   **Corrective Feedback:** [e.g., "Treat the real and imaginary parts as separate components, like `x` and `y` coordinates: `(2+1) + (3+4)i = 3+7i`."]

## Adaptive Learning Metadata
*   **Prerequisite Topics:**
    - "[File_ID for a prerequisite topic, e.g., P3_1_1_v1.0]"
    - "[File_ID for another prerequisite topic]"
*   **Follow-up Topics:**
    - "[File_ID for a topic that builds on this one, e.g., P3_8_2_v1.0]"
*   **Scaffolding Suggestions:** [Provide a link or description for a simpler version of the problem to build confidence. e.g., "Practice adding two complex numbers before attempting multiplication."]
*   **Extension Challenges:** [Provide a link or description for a more complex problem. e.g., "Solve a problem involving division of complex numbers, which requires using the conjugate."]

## API Integration Fields
*   **Question_Bank_IDs:**
    - "[Internal_QB_ID_12345]"
*   **Asset_Links:**
    - "![Diagram Description](URL_to_relevant_image.png)"
    - "[Link to a relevant video tutorial]"
*   **Interactive_Component_ID:** "[ID_for_a_related_quiz_or_widget]"

### **File Naming and Formatting Rules**

**1. File Naming Convention:**
Files must be named using a consistent, machine-readable format that encapsulates their content:
`[Topic_Number].[Sub_Topic_Number] [Sub_Topic_Name].md`

*   **Example:** `8.1 Complex Numbers - Basics.md`
*   **Example:** `7.1 Vectors in 2 Dimensions.md`

**2. Key Formatting Rules:**
*   **Mathematical Syntax:** All mathematical expressions, variables, and formulas **must** be rendered using LaTeX. Use `$$...$$` for block display equations and `$..$` for inline mathematics for clarity and consistent rendering.
*   **Clean Markdown:** The file must contain **only** the content and metadata as specified in the template. Do not include extraneous text, headers, footers, or promotional material (e.g., "Head to www.savemyexams.com").
*   **Structure:** Adhere strictly to the heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`) defined in the template to maintain a consistent document object model (DOM) for parsing.
*   **Clarity:** Explanations should be direct and unambiguous. The goal is to create a standalone, permanent educational resource.

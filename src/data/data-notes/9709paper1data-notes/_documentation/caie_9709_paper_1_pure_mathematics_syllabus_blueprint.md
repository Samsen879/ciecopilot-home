## 1. Quadratics

### **Subtopics & Learning Objectives**
- **Completing the Square:**
    - Carry out the process of completing the square for a quadratic polynomial `ax² + bx + c`.
    - Use the completed square form to find the vertex (minimum or maximum point) of the parabola.
    - Use the completed square form to sketch the graph of the quadratic function.
- **The Discriminant:**
    - Understand and use the discriminant (`b² - 4ac`) to determine the number and nature of the real roots of a quadratic equation.
    - Apply the discriminant to problems involving intersections of a line and a curve (e.g., finding conditions for a line to be a tangent or not intersect a parabola).
- **Solving Equations and Inequalities:**
    - Solve quadratic equations by factorisation, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula.
    - Solve quadratic inequalities (e.g., `ax² + bx + c > 0`) by sketching the graph or using other valid methods.
- **Simultaneous Equations:**
    - Solve simultaneous equations in two variables where one equation is linear and the other is quadratic.
- **Equations in Quadratic Form:**
    - Recognize and solve equations that are "quadratic in xⁿ" or another function of x (e.g., `x⁴ - 5x² + 4 = 0`).

### **Key Formulas**
| Formula | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}` | The quadratic formula for solving `ax² + bx + c = 0`. |
| `\Delta = b^2 - 4ac` | The discriminant. |
| `y = a(x - h)² + k` | Completed square form, where `(h, k)` is the vertex. |

### **Exam Question Analysis**
- **Style:** Questions are typically multi-part and often link different concepts.
- **Logic:** A common question type involves a line (`y = mx + c`) and a curve (`y = ax² + bx + c`). You will be asked to use the discriminant to find the range of values for a variable (like `m` or `c`) for which the line and curve have two distinct intersection points (`b² - 4ac > 0`), one point (tangent, `b² - 4ac = 0`), or no points (`b² - 4ac < 0`).
- **Inequalities:** Solving quadratic inequalities is a standard, often standalone question or part of a larger problem. Marks are awarded for finding the critical values and then identifying the correct range.

## 2. Functions

### **Subtopics & Learning Objectives**
- **Core Concepts:**
    - Understand and use the terms: *function, domain, range, one-one function, inverse function (`f⁻¹`), and composition of functions (`fg`)*.
- **Function Properties:**
    - Determine if a function is one-one by graphical (horizontal line test) or algebraic methods.
    - Find the inverse of a one-one function (`f⁻¹(x)`) and state its domain and range.
    - Understand the relationship between the graph of a function and its inverse (reflection in the line `y = x`).
- **Composition:**
    - Form and find the domain/range of composite functions like `fg(x)` and `f²(x)`.
    - Solve equations involving composite functions (e.g., `fg(x) = k`).
- **Graph Transformations:**
    - Understand and illustrate the transformations `y = f(x) + a`, `y = f(x + a)`, `y = af(x)`, and `y = f(ax)`.
    - Apply these transformations to the graphs of `y = kxⁿ`, `y = 1/x`, `y = 1/x²` and trigonometric functions.

### **Key Formulas & Concepts**
| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inverse Function** | To find `f⁻¹(x)`, let `y = f(x)`, make `x` the subject, and then swap `x` and `y`. |
| `(fg)(x)` | `f(g(x))`. |
| **Domain & Range** | The domain of `f⁻¹` is the range of `f`. The range of `f⁻¹` is the domain of `f`. |
| `y=f(x)+a` | Translation by vector `(0, a)` |
| `y=f(x+a)` | Translation by vector `(-a, 0)` |
| `y=af(x)` | Stretch parallel to the y-axis, factor `a` |
| `y=f(ax)` | Stretch parallel to the x-axis, factor `1/a` |

### **Exam Question Analysis**
- **Style:** Often starts with defining functions `f(x)` and `g(x)`. Parts will ask to find the range, determine if `f` is one-one, find `f⁻¹`, and solve an equation like `fg(x) = c` or `f(x) = f⁻¹(x)`.
- **Logic:** The "Show that..." command is common, requiring clear algebraic steps. Sketching transformed graphs is also a frequent requirement, demanding accurately labelled axes and key points (intercepts, turning points).

## 3. Coordinate Geometry

### **Subtopics & Learning Objectives**
- **Lines:**
    - Find the equation of a straight line given sufficient information (e.g., two points, or one point and the gradient).
    - Use the forms `y = mx + c`, `y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)`, and `ax + by + c = 0`.
    - Understand the relationship between the gradients of parallel lines (`m₁ = m₂`) and perpendicular lines (`m₁m₂ = -1`).
    - Calculate the distance between two points and find the midpoint of a line segment.
- **Circles:**
    - Understand and use the equation of a circle: `(x - a)² + (y - b)² = r²`.
    - Use the properties of circles: the angle in a semicircle is a right angle; the perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord; the tangent at any point is perpendicular to the radius at that point.
- **Problem Solving:**
    - Solve geometric problems involving intersections of a line and a circle, or two circles.
    - Find the equation of the tangent to a circle at a given point.

### **Key Formulas**
| Formula | Description |

| `d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}` | Distance between two points. |
| `M = (\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})` | Midpoint of a line segment. |
| `(x - a)² + (y - b)² = r²` | Equation of a circle with centre `(a, b)` and radius `r`. |

### **Exam Question Analysis**
- **Style:** Long, structured questions are common. A typical problem might provide the coordinates of three points (A, B, C) and ask for properties of the resulting triangle, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of a side, and the coordinates of the centre of the circumscribed circle.
- **Logic:** Problems often require a chain of deductions. For example, to find the equation of a tangent to a circle, you must first find the gradient of the radius to that point, then use the perpendicular gradient rule to find the tangent's gradient, and finally use the point-gradient form.

## 4. Circular Measure

### **Subtopics & Learning Objectives**
- **Radians:**
    - Understand the definition of a radian and convert between radians and degrees.
- **Arc Length and Sector Area:**
    - Use the formulas for arc length (`s = rθ`) and area of a sector (`A = ½r²θ`) for a circle, where `θ` is in radians.
- **Problem Solving:**
    - Solve problems involving the arc length and sector area of a circle. This often includes finding the area or perimeter of a segment or complex shapes made from sectors and triangles.

### **Key Formulas**
| Formula | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `s = rθ` | Arc length (θ in radians). |
| `A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta` | Area of a sector (θ in radians). |
| `180° = \pi \text{ radians}` | Conversion factor. |

### **Exam Question Analysis**
- **Style:** Problems are almost always presented with a diagram showing a shape composed of sectors, triangles, and segments.
- **Logic:** Questions require you to identify the different geometric components of a shape. You might need to use trigonometry (e.g., sine or cosine rule) to find a required angle or side length *before* you can apply the circular measure formulas. The final step is often finding a shaded area, which involves subtracting the area of a triangle from the area of a sector.

    - Solve trigonometric equations within a given range, finding all solutions. This includes equations of the form `sin(ax + b) = k` and equations that can be reduced to a quadratic in `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, or `tan(x)`.

### **Key Formulas**
| Formula | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `\tan\theta \equiv \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}` | The tangent identity. |
| `\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta \equiv 1` | The Pythagorean identity. |

### **Exam Question Analysis**
- **Style:** Two main types of questions appear:
    1.  **Equation Solving:** You are given a complex trigonometric equation. The first part asks you to "Show that" it can be simplified into a quadratic form (e.g., `2sin²θ - 3sinθ + 1 = 0`). The second part asks you to solve this equation for a given interval.
    2.  **Graph Sketching:** You will be asked to sketch a transformed trigonometric graph, such as `y = 3\cos(2x) - 1`, showing key features like amplitude, period, and intercepts.
- **Logic:** When solving equations, it is crucial to find the principal value from the calculator and then use the CAST diagram or graph symmetries to find all other solutions in the required range.

### **Key Formulas**
| Progression | Formula | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Binomial** |`(a+b)^n = a^n + \binom{n}{1}a^{n-1}b + \binom{n}{2}a^{n-2}b^2 + ... + b^n`| Binomial expansion. |
| **AP** |`u_n = a + (n-1)d` | *n*th term. |

| **GP** |`S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1-r}` | Sum to infinity (`|r| < 1`). |

### **Exam Question Analysis**
- **Style:**
    - **Binomial:** Find the first 3 or 4 terms in the expansion of an expression like `(2 - x)⁵`. A subsequent part often asks you to use this expansion to find the coefficient of a specific power of `x` in a more complex expression, e.g., `(1 + 2x)(2 - x)⁵`.
    - **AP/GP:** Questions often require setting up and solving simultaneous equations based on information given (e.g., "the 3rd term is 10 and the sum of the first 8 terms is 140"). Sum to infinity questions are common and test the condition `|r| < 1`.

    - Part (a) asks for `dy/dx` and `d²y/dx²`.
    - Part (b) asks you to find the coordinates of the stationary points.
    - Part (c) asks you to determine their nature.
    - Part (d) might ask for the equation of the tangent at a specific point on the curve.
- **Logic:** You must be comfortable with rewriting expressions with fractional and negative indices (e.g., `\sqrt{x}` as `x¹/²` and `1/x²` as `x⁻²`) before differentiating.

### **Exam Question Analysis**
- **Style:** Questions are heavily application-based and are frequently linked with coordinate geometry.
- **Logic:** A typical question will show a diagram with a shaded region bounded by a curve and one or more straight lines.
    - Part (a) will ask you to find the coordinates of the intersection points (using algebra).
    - Part (b) will ask for the area of the shaded region. This often requires you to calculate the area under the curve using integration and subtract the area of a simpler shape (like a trapezium or triangle), or to subtract the area under one curve from another.
    - A final part might ask for the volume of revolution of this region. You must be careful to use `\pi y²` in the integral.

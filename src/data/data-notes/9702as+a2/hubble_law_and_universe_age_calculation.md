## Astronomy and cosmology: Hubble's Law and the Age of the Universe

**Syllabus Reference**: 9702.25
**Learning Objective**: (h) recall and use Hubble’s law, $v \approx H_0 d$. (i) understand that Hubble’s law is evidence for an expanding universe. (j) understand that the age of the universe can be estimated from the Hubble constant, $t \approx 1/H_0$.

### Example Question
(a) State Hubble's law.

(b) The hydrogen-alpha spectral line has a wavelength of $656.3$ nm when measured in a laboratory on Earth. Light from a distant galaxy shows this same spectral line at a measured wavelength of $689.1$ nm.
(i) Show that the recessional velocity of the galaxy is approximately $1.5 \times 10^7$ m s⁻¹.
(ii) The Hubble constant $H_0$ is taken to be $2.3 \times 10^{-18}$ s⁻¹. Calculate the distance to this galaxy.

(c) Using the given value of the Hubble constant, estimate the age of the universe in years.
($1 \text{ year} = 3.16 \times 10^7 \text{ s}$)

### Mark Scheme / Solution
- (a) The recessional velocity $v$ of a distant galaxy is directly proportional to its distance $d$ from Earth. (Accept $v = H_0 d$ with terms defined). (B1)

- (b) (i)
- Change in wavelength $\Delta\lambda = 689.1 - 656.3 = 32.8$ nm. (C1)
- Use of the redshift equation for velocity: $v = c \frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda}$. (M1)
- Correct substitution: $v = (3.00 \times 10^8) \times \frac{32.8 \text{ nm}}{656.3 \text{ nm}} = 1.499 \times 10^7 \text{ m s}^{-1} \approx 1.5 \times 10^7 \text{ m s}^{-1}$. (A1)

- (b) (ii)
- Rearrangement of Hubble's law: $d = \frac{v}{H_0}$. (M1)
- Correct substitution: $d = \frac{1.5 \times 10^7 \text{ m s}^{-1}}{2.3 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1}} = 6.5 \times 10^{24}$ m. (A1)

- (c)
- The age of the universe $t$ is estimated by $t \approx \frac{1}{H_0}$. (C1)
- Calculation in seconds: $t = \frac{1}{2.3 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1}} = 4.35 \times 10^{17}$ s. (M1)
- Conversion to years: $t = \frac{4.35 \times 10^{17} \text{ s}}{3.16 \times 10^7 \text{ s/year}} = 1.38 \times 10^{10}$ years. (or 13.8 billion years). (A1)

### Standard Solution Steps
- **Part (a):** Recall the formal definition of Hubble's law relating recessional velocity and distance.
- **Part (b)(i):**
    - First, calculate the change in wavelength, $\Delta\lambda$, by subtracting the laboratory wavelength from the observed wavelength.
    - Use the Doppler redshift formula for light, $v = c(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda})$, substituting the speed of light $c$, the change in wavelength $\Delta\lambda$, and the original laboratory wavelength $\lambda$.
- **Part (b)(ii):**
    - Rearrange Hubble's law ($v=H_0d$) to make distance $d$ the subject: $d = v/H_0$.
    - Substitute the velocity calculated in the previous part and the given value of the Hubble constant to find the distance.
- **Part (c):**
    - Recall that the age of the universe can be estimated as the inverse of the Hubble constant, $t \approx 1/H_0$.
    - Calculate this value, which will give the age in seconds.
    - Convert the age from seconds to years using the provided conversion factor.

### Common Mistakes
- **Redshift Calculation:** Confusing the change in wavelength $\Delta\lambda$ with the observed wavelength $\lambda_{obs}$. The formula uses the original source wavelength $\lambda$ in the denominator.
- **Unit for Hubble Constant:** The Hubble constant is often given in km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹. If so, significant unit conversions are required. In this question, it is given in SI base units (s⁻¹) to simplify, but students may still make errors if they are used to the other form.
- **Age of Universe:** Inverting the formula to $t=H_0$ by mistake.
- **Final Unit Conversion:** Forgetting to convert the age of the universe from seconds to years as required by the question.
- **Algebraic Errors:** Simple mistakes when rearranging Hubble's law.

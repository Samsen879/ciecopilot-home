# **Quality Assurance Report: CAIE Physics 9702 Document Template Conformance**

## 1. Consistency Summary

A comprehensive review of the provided CAIE Physics 9702 topic documents was conducted to verify conformance against the specified Markdown template.

**Conclusion**: A significant majority of the documents **do not conform** to the standard template. Deviations fall into three primary categories: the inclusion of numerous unauthorized fields, incorrect hierarchical structure and formatting, and minor formatting errors such as the use of numbered lists where dashed lists are required. Only a minority of the documents adhere strictly to all template rules.

## 2. Analysis of Document Conformance

The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the conformance status for each reviewed file.

| Filename | Conformance Status | Details of Deviations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `kinematics motion graphs.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Major Deviations**: The document contains numerous extra fields not specified in the template, including `Difficulty Profile`, `Cognitive Skills`, `Prerequisite Skills`, `Teaching Insights`, `Adaptive Learning Metadata`, and `API Integration Fields`. It also incorrectly uses the heading `### Error Analysis` instead of the required `### Common Mistakes`. |
| `newton's laws of motion and momentum impulse.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Major Deviations**: Follows the same incorrect, extended template as the previous file, with multiple extra fields and the use of `### Error Analysis` instead of `### Common Mistakes`. |
| `forces density and pressure.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Major Deviations**: Contains unauthorized fields (`Difficulty Profile`, `Teaching Insights`, etc.) and uses the incorrect `### Error Analysis` heading. |
| `work energy and power conservation and calculation.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Major Deviations**: Contains unauthorized fields and uses `### Error Analysis` instead of the required `### Common Mistakes`. |
| `deformation of solids stress strain and young modulus.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Major Deviations**: Contains unauthorized fields and uses `### Error Analysis` instead of the required `### Common Mistakes`. |
| `progressive wave properties and doppler effect.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Structural Deviation**: The entire document structure deviates from the template. Required top-level fields (`## Topic...`, `**Syllabus Reference**:`, etc.) are absent. Content is incorrectly nested under `### **Question...**` and `####` headings, and uses list items for metadata (`- **Syllabus_Reference**: ...`). |
| `superposition interference and diffraction.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Structural Deviation**: The document does not follow the template structure. It uses an incorrect hierarchy with `### **Question...**` and `####` headers and nests metadata within lists. |
| `electricity circuits concepts.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Structural Deviation**: Exhibits a complete structural deviation from the required template, using incorrect headers and metadata formatting. |
| `battery internal resistance and circuit analysis.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Structural Deviation**: The document structure is incorrect. Required top-level fields are absent, and content is improperly nested under non-standard headers. |
| `nuclear structure and radiation properties.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Structural Deviation**: Fails to adhere to the template's top-level structure, using an incorrect hierarchy for headers and metadata. |
| `circular motion on a banked track.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Structural Deviation**: The document's structure is entirely non-compliant, with content nested incorrectly under non-standard headers. |
| `gravitational fields analysis.md` | **Conforming** | No issues found. The document adheres to all specified fields, ordering, and formatting rules. |
| `temperature specific heat latent heat and thermodynamic scale.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Formatting Deviation**: The `### Standard Solution Steps` section uses a numbered list format (`1. Part (a)...`), which violates the requirement for a simple dashed list (`- [Value]`). |
| `ideal gases physics concepts and calculations.md` | **Conforming** | No issues found. The document adheres to all specified fields, ordering, and formatting rules. |
| `thermodynamics first law and work done calculation.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Formatting Deviation**: The `### Standard Solution Steps` section incorrectly uses a numbered list (`1. Identify...`). |
| `oscillations simple harmonic motion energy calculations.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Formatting Deviation**: The `### Standard Solution Steps` section incorrectly uses a numbered list (`1. Identify...`). |
| `electric fields and potential calculations.md` | **Conforming** | No issues found. The document adheres to all specified fields, ordering, and formatting rules. |
| `capacitor charge energy and discharge calculations.md` | **Conforming** | No issues found. The document adheres to all specified fields, ordering, and formatting rules. |
| `force on conductor and electromagnetic induction.md` | **Conforming** | No issues found. The document adheres to all specified fields, ordering, and formatting rules. |
| `alternating currents rms rectification smoothing.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Formatting Deviation**: The `### Standard Solution Steps` section incorrectly uses a numbered list (`1. Part (a)...`). |
| `photoelectric effect and de broglie wavelength calculations.md` | **Conforming** | No issues found. The document adheres to all specified fields, ordering, and formatting rules. |
| `nuclear physics binding energy and radioactive decay calculations.md` | **Conforming** | No issues found. The document adheres to all specified fields, ordering, and formatting rules. |
| `medical imaging principles ultrasound xray.md` | **Non-Conforming** | **Formatting Deviation**: The `### Standard Solution Steps` section incorrectly uses a numbered list (`1. Part (a)(i)...`). |
| `hubble law and universe age calculation.md` | **Conforming** | No issues found. The document adheres to all specified fields, ordering, and formatting rules. |
| `physical quantities and units errors and uncertainties.md` | **Partially Conforming** | **Formatting Deviation**: The first two documents (`Homogeneity...` and `Errors...`) incorrectly use a numbered-style list (`- Step 1...`) for `Standard Solution Steps`. The third document (`Scalars and Vectors`) conforms to the template. |
